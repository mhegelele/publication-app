Prediction of cutaneous leishmaniasis epidemics in Tunisia remains difficult because most of the epidemiological tools used so far are descriptive in nature and mainly focus on a time dimension. The purpose of this work is to predict the potential geographic distribution of Phlebotomus papatasi and zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major in Tunisia using Grinnellian ecological niche modeling. We attempted to assess the importance of environmental factors influencing the potential distribution of P. papatasi and cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major. Vectors were trapped in central Tunisia during the transmission season using CDC light traps (John W. Hock Co., Gainesville, FL). A global positioning system was used to record the geographical coordinates of vector occurrence points and households tested positive for cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major. Nine environmental layers were used as predictor variables to model the P. papatasi geographical distribution and five variables were used to model the L. major potential distribution. Ecological niche modeling was used to relate known species' occurrence points to values of environmental factors for these same points to predict the presence of the species in unsampled regions based on the value of the predictor variables. Rainfall and temperature contributed the most as predictors for sand flies and human case distributions. Ecological niche modeling anticipated the current distribution of P. papatasi with the highest suitability for species occurrence in the central and southeastern part of Tunisian. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that governorates of Gafsa, Sidi Bouzid, and Kairouan are at highest epidemic risk."

To address this gap we conducted a study of mRDT-negative fever aetiologies among children and adults in Tanzania. Methods: 1028 patients aged 3 months to 50 years with a febrile illness and negative mRDT were enrolled from a Tanzanian hospital outpatient department. All had a physical examination and cultures from blood, nasopharynx/throat and urine. Patients were followed on Days 7 and 14 and children meeting WHO criteria for pneumonia were followed on Day 2 with chest radiology. Results: Respiratory symptoms were the most frequent presenting complaint, reported by 20.3% of adults and 64.0% (339/530) of children. Of 38 X-rayed children meeting WHO pneumonia criteria 47.4% had a normal X-ray. Overall only 1.3% of 1028 blood cultures were positive. Salmonella typhi was the most prevalent pathogen isolated (7/13, 53.8%) and S. typhi patients reported fever for a median of 7 days (range 2-14). Children with bacteraemia did not present with WHO symptoms requiring antibiotic treatment. Young children and adults had similar prevalences of positive urine cultures (24/428 and 29/498, respectively). Conclusion: Few outpatient fevers are caused by blood stream bacterial infection and most adult bacteraemia would be identified by current clinical guidelines although paediatric bacteraemia may be more difficult to diagnose. While pneumonia may be over-diagnosed, urinary tract infection was relatively common. Our results emphasise the difficulty in identifying African children in need of antibiotics among the majority who do not. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

Defining the significance of NTM in settings with endemic tuberculosis (TB) requires the discrimination of NTM from TB in suspect patients. Correct and timely identification of NTM will impact both therapy and epidemiology of TB and TB-like diseases. The present study aimed at determining the frequency and diversity of NTM among TB suspects in northeastern Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2012 through January 2013. Seven hundred and forty-four sputum samples were collected from 372 TB suspects. Detection was done by using phenotypic, GenoType® Mycobacterium CM/AS kits, 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing for identification of isolates not identified by Hain kits. Binary regression model was used to analyse the predictors of NTM detection. The prevalence of NTM was 9.7 % of the mycobacterial isolates. Out of 36 patients with confirmed NTM infection, 12 were HIV infected with HIV being a significant predictor of NTM detection (P < 0.001). Co-infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) was found in five patients. Twenty-eight NTM isolates were identified using GenoType® Mycobacterium CM/AS and eight isolates could not be identified. Identified species included M. gordonae and M. interjectum 6 (16.7 %), M. intracelullare 4 (11.1 %), M. avium spp. and M. fortuitum 2 (5.5 %), M. kansasii, M. lentiflavum, M. simiae, M. celatum, M. marinum 1 (2.8 %) each. Of isolates not identified to subspecies level, we identified M. kumamotonense (2), M. intracellulare/kansasii, M. intermedium/triplex, M. acapulcensis/flavescens, M. stomatepiae, M. colombiense and M. terrae complex (1) each using 16S rRNA sequencing. Additionally, hsp65 gene sequencing identified M. kumamotonense, M. scrofulaceum/M. avium, M. avium, M. flavescens/novocastrense, M. kumamotonense/hiberniae, M. lentiflavum, M. colombiense/M. avium and M. kumamotonense/terrae/hiberniae (1) each. Results of the 16S rRNA and hsp65 gene sequencing were concordant in three and discordant in five isolates not identified by GenoType® Mycobacterium CM/AS. NTM infections may play a vital role in causing lung disease and impact management of TB in endemic settings. GenoType® Mycobacterium CM/AS represents a useful tool to identify clinical NTM infections. However, 16S rRNA gene sequencing should be thought for confirmatory diagnosis of the clinical isolates. Due to the complexity and inconsistence of NTM identification, we recommend diagnosis of NTM infections be centralized by strengthening and setting up quality national and regional infrastructure. "

Methods: Data were collected between March, 2014 to March, 2015 through semi-structured questionnaires involving male and female heads of the households (Bomas), participant observations, as well as focus group discussions (FGD) with knowledgeable tribe leaders (Leingwenanis) and other key informants in the area. Qualitative and quantitative data analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Science and Ms Excel computer software tools. A total of 174 participants were interviewed on the use of ethno-medicine to control mosquitoes and treat mosquito related diseases. Results: About 35% of the respondents indicate to use treated bednets while 41% of interviewed respondents mentioned to use combination of methods including keeping home premises clean, followed by only a few (2%) who claimed to use repellent plants/herbs. Knowledge on medicinal plants used for malaria remedies was immense, and seemed to be a preferred treatment before consulting medical personnels. This was evident in FGD where the Maasai communities indicated to rely more on malaria parasite treatment by taking some herbal remedies that clears the parasites in the blood than using plants for controlling/killing mosquitoes. Majority of respondents were aware of diseases caused by mosquitoes with frequency mention of malaria (75%). Tagetes minuta (Nang’ongudeyo), Cynodon plectostachyus (Emurua) and Azadirachta indica (Mwarobaini) were frequently metioned as mosquito repellent plants and obtained from the study areas. Likewise, Salvadora persica (Oremit/Mswaki) and Osyris abyssinica (Olesai) were highly ranked as effective anti-malarial plants. Conclusion: There is great need to conserve the documented plant species used in control of mosquitoes and treat mosquito related diseases in the area concurrently preserving the indigenous knowledge amidst a rapidly changing Maasai society as well as unpredicted climate changes."

However, there is no comprehensive data on the risk of transmission of dengue in the country. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of transmission of dengue in Dar es Salaam during the 2014 epidemic.                                                                                                                                 METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania during the dengue outbreak of 2014. The study involved Ilala, Kinondoni and Temeke districts. Adult mosquitoes were collected using carbon dioxide-propane powered Mosquito Magnet Liberty Plus traps. In each household compound, water-holding containers were examined for mosquito larvae and pupae. Dengue virus infection of mosquitoes was determined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Partial amplification and sequencing of dengue virus genome in infected mosquitoes was performed. A total of 1,000 adult mosquitoes were collected. Over half (59.9%) of the adult mosquitoes were collected in Kinondoni. Aedes aegypti accounted for 17.2% of the mosquitoes of which 90.6% were from Kinondoni. Of a total of 796 houses inspected, 38.3% had water-holding containers in their premises. Kinondoni had the largest proportion of water-holding containers (57.7%), followed by Temeke (31.4%) and Ilala (23.4%). The most common breeding containers for the Aedes mosquitoes were discarded plastic containers and tires. High Aedes infestation indices were observed for all districts and sites, with a house index of 18.1% in Ilala, 25.5% in Temeke and 35.3% in Kinondoni. The respective container indices were 77.4%, 65.2% and 80.2%. Of the reared larvae and pupae, 5,250 adult mosquitoes emerged, of which 61.9% were Ae. aegypti. Overall, 27 (8.18) of the 330 pools of Ae. aegypti were positive for dengue virus. On average, the overall maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) indicates pooled infection rate of 8.49 per 1,000 mosquitoes (95%CI = 5.72-12.16). There was no significant difference in pooled infection rates between the districts. Dengue viruses in the tested mosquitoes clustered into serotype 2 cosmopolitan genotype.                                                                                                                                                                                 CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ae. aegypti is the main vector of dengue in Dar es Salaam and breeds mainly in medium size plastic containers and tires. The Aedes house indices were high, indicating that the three districts were at high risk of dengue transmission. The 2014 dengue outbreak was caused by Dengue virus serotype 2. The high mosquito larval and pupal indices in the area require intensification of vector surveillance along with source reduction and health education."

Of the 1836 respondents, 1157 and 679 respondents sought healthcare services on their last visit at public or non-public health facilities, respectively. While 45.5% rated the quality of services to be good in both types of facilities, reported medicine shortages were more pronounced among those who visited public rather than non-public health facilities (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.4, 2.1). Respondents who visited public facilities were 4.9 times less likely than those who visited non-public facilities to emphasise the influence of cost in accessing and utilising health care (OR = 4.9, CI 3.9-6.1). A significant difference was also found in the provider-client relationship satisfaction level between non-public (89.1%) and public facilities (74.7%) (OR = 2.8, CI: 1.5-5.0), indicating a level of lower trust in the later. Revised strategies are needed to ensure availability of medicines in public facilities, which are used by the majority of the population, while strengthening private-public partnerships to harmonise healthcare costs."

In Tanzania, many studies focus on increasing community knowledge and awareness on malaria prevention but the potential participation and contribution of schoolchildren towards knowledge, attitudes and practices on malaria has received little attention. We investigated the knowledge and understanding of primary school children on malaria transmission, recognition of symptoms, treatment seeking behaviour, preventive measures and practices in order to potentially include this group in Tanzania’s malaria control efforts. 125 children were recr uited fr om thr ee purposively selected primar y schools in Bagamoyo district, Tanzania. A semi-structured interview guide, including both closed and open-ended questions, was used to collect information from the participants to obtain their knowledge and understanding on malaria transmission, treatment and prevention. More than half of the school children (79/125; 63.2% ) had knowledge on malar ia as a disease and its transmission; 101/125 (80.8%) of the respondents reported that going to the hospital was their immediate care-seeking behaviour once they felt malaria symptoms, while 14/125 (11.2%) opted for self-medication. With regard to malaria prevention and control, 115/125 (92.0%) of the respondents reported using bednets as their main malaria prevention strategy, while 6/125 (4.8%) preferred the use of medicine, mostly artemether lumefantrine, as prophylaxis. Narratives obtained were able to explain clearly the rationale behind different options children took to treat and to protect themselves against malaria. Findings indicated that primary school childr en in Bagamoyo district ar e aware of malaria, its symptoms and preventive measures, although some had misconceptions and could not associate the disease with its transmission. We conclude that inclusion of school children on malaria control educational programmes could yield substantial benefits towards malaria elimination."

RESULTS: Fourteen school health interventions (SHI) or AHI are currently being implemented by the Government of Tanzania. Most are delivered as vertical programmes. Coverage of current programs is not universal, and is limited by financial, human resource and logistic constraints. Limited community engagement, rumours, and lack of strategic advocacy has affected uptake of some interventions, e.g. tetanus toxoid (TT) immunization. Stakeholder and KI perceptions and opinions were limited by a lack of experience with integrated delivery and AHI that were outside an individual's area of expertise and experience. Deworming and educational sessions including reproductive health education were the most frequently mentioned interventions that respondents considered suitable for integrated delivery with HPV vaccine.                                                                                                                           CONCLUSIONS: Given programme constraints, limited experience with integrated delivery and concern about real or perceived side-effects being attributed to the vaccine, it will be very important to pilot-test integration of AHI/SHI with HPV vaccination. Selected interventions will need to be simple and quick to deliver since health workers are likely to face significant logistic and time constraints during vaccination visits."

It is a mosquito-borne disease found endemically and exclusively in low-income contexts where, concomitantly, general public health care is often deeply troubled and fails to meet the basic health needs of impoverished populations. This presents particular challenges for the implementation of mass drug administration (MDA), which currently is the principal means of control and eventual elimination. Several MDA programmes face the dilemma that they are unable to attain and maintain the required drug coverage across target groups. In recognition of this, a qualitative study was conducted in the Morogoro and Lindi regions of Tanzania to gain an understanding of community experiences with, and perceptions of, the MDA campaign implemented in 2011 by the National Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programme. The study revealed a wide variation of perceptions and experiences regarding the aim, rationale and justification of MDA. There were positive sentiments about the usefulness of the drugs, but many study participants were sceptical about the manner in which MDA is implemented. People were particularly disappointed with the limited attempts by implementers to share information and mobilize residents. In addition, negative sentiments towards MDA for lymphatic filariasis reflected a general feeling of desertion and marginalization by the health care system and political authorities. However, the results suggest that if the communities are brought on board with genuine respect for their integrity and informed self-determination, there is scope for major improvements in community support for MDA-based control activities."

In the Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem, humans, livestock and wildlife live in close proximity, which exposes them to the risk of a number of zoonotic infectious diseases, including leptospirosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cross-sectional epidemiological study was carried out in the Katavi region, South-west Tanzania, to determine the seroprevalence of Leptospira spp in humans, domestic rumi- nants and wildlife. Blood samples were collected from humans (n = 267), cattle (n = 1,103), goats (n = 248), buffaloes (n = 38), zebra (n = 2), lions (n = 2), rodents (n = 207) and shrews (n = 11). Decanted sera were tested using the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) for an- tibodies against six live serogroups belonging to the Leptospira spp , with a cutoff point of 1:160. The prevalence of leptospiral antibodies was 29.96% in humans, 30.37% in cattle, 8.47% in goats, 28.95% in buffaloes, 20.29% in rodents and 9.09% in shrews. Additionally, one of the two samples in lions was seropositive. A significant difference in the prevalence P < 0.05 was observed between cattle and goats. No significant difference in prevalence was observed with respect to age and sex in humans or any of the sampled animal species. The most prevalent serogroups with antibodies of Leptospira spp were Sejroe, Hebdoma- dis, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagie and Australis, which were detected in humans, cattle, goats and buffaloes; Sejroe and Grippotyphosa, which were detected in a lion; Aus- tralis, Icterohaemorrhagie and Grippotyphosa, which were detected in rodents; and Austra- lis, which was detected in shrews. Antibodies to serogroup Ballum were detected only in humans. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that leptospiral antibodies are widely prevalent in hu- mans, livestock and wildlife from the Katavi-Rukwa ecosystem. The disease poses a seri- ous economic and public health threat in the study area. This epidemiological study provides information on circulating serogroups, which will be essential in designing inter- vention measures to reduce the risk of disease transmission."

By 2 years after infection, 35% of HISIS subjects developed neutralization breadth, compared with 9% of CAPRISA subjects (P = .0131). Cumulative viral loads between 3 and 12 months were higher in the HISIS group (P = .046) and strongly associated with breadth (P < .0001).

However, SP is still being used for intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP). This study aimed to assess the pattern of P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (Pfdhfr) and dihydropteroate synthetase (Pfdhps) mutations and associated haplotypes in areas with different malaria transmission intensities in mainland Tanzania, 6 years after withdrawal of SP as a first-line treatment regimen for uncomplicated malaria. A total of 264 samples were collected during cross-sectional surveys in three districts of Muheza, Muleba and Nachingwea in Tanga, Kagera and Lindi regions, respectively. Parasite genomic DNA was extracted from P. falciparum positive samples. The Pfdhfr, Pfdhps single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were amplified using nested polymerase chain reaction and detected by sequence specific oligonucleotide probe-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (SSOP-ELISA). The prevalence of the mutant Pfdhfr-Pfdhps haplotypes was heterogenous and transmission dependent. The triple Pfdhfr mutant haplotypes (CIRNI) were predominant in all sites with significantly higher frequencies at Muheza (93.3 %) compared to Muleba (75.0 %) and Nachingwea districts (70.6 %), (p < 0.001). Overall, the prevalence of the wild-type Pfdhps (SAKAA) haplotype was lowest at Muheza (1.3 %), (p = 0.002). Double Pfdhps haplotype SGEAA was significantly high at Muheza (27.2 %) and Muleba (20.8 %) while none (0 %) was detected at Nachingwea (p < 0.001). The prevalence of triple Pfdhps SGEGA haplotype was significantly higher at Muheza compared to Muleba and Nachingwea (p < 0.001). In contrast, Nachingwea and Muleba had significantly higher prevalence of another triple Pfdhps AGEAA haplotype (?2 = 39.9, p < 0.001). Conversely, Pfdhfr-Pfdhps as quintuple and sextuple haplotypes were predominant including the emergence of a septuple mutant haplotype CIRNI-AGEGA (n = 11) observed at Muheza and Muleba. These results ascertain the high prevalence and saturation of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps haplotypes conferring SP resistance in areas with changing malaria epidemiology; and this could undermine the use of IPTp-SP in improving pregnancy outcomes. In these settings where high level SP resistance is documented, additional control efforts are needed and evaluation of an alternative drug for IPTp is an urgent priority"

The role of the microbiota in pregnancy and nutrition is a promising new area of study with potential health ramifications. In many African countries, maternal and infant death and morbidity are associated with malnutrition. Here, we assess the influence of probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, supplemented with Moringa plant as a source of micronutrients, on the health and oral, gut, vaginal and milk microbiotas of 56 pregnant women in Tanzania. In an open label study design, 26 subjects received yogurt daily and 30 were untreated during the last two trimesters and for one month after birth. Samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and dietary recalls were recorded. Women initially categorized as nourished or undernourished consumed similar calories and macronutrients, which may explain why there was no difference in the microbiota at any body site. Consumption of yogurt increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and decreased Enterobacteriaceae in the newborn feces but had no effect on the mother's microbiota at any body site. The microbiota of the oral cavity and GI tract remained stable over pregnancy, but the vaginal microbiota showed a significant increase in diversity leading up to and after birth. In summary, daily micronutrient-supplemented probiotic yogurt provides a safe, affordable food for pregnant women in rural Tanzania and the resultant improvement in the gut microbial profile of infants is worthy of further "

All model fittings were conducted in the R statistical software environment (version 3.0.2), using the lm and nls functions. Results: TTP showed a negative correlation with log10 cfu on all 14 days of the study. There was an increasing gradient of the regression line and y-intercept as treatment progressed. There was also a trend towards an increasing gradient with higher doses of rifampicin. Conclusions: These data suggest that there is a population of mycobacterial cells that are more numerous when detected in liquid than on solid medium. Increasing doses of rifampicin differentially kill this group of organisms. These findings support the idea that increased doses of rifampicin are more effective."

Methods:A case-control study was conducted in Tanzania to establish factors that determine access to a health facility in acute febrile illnesses in children less than 5 years of age. Carers of eligible children were interviewed in the community; cases were represented by patients who went to a facility and controls by those who did not. A Household Wealth Index was estimated using principal components analysis. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to understand the factors which influenced attendance of healthcare facility including severity of the illness and household wealth/socio-demographic indicators. To complement the data on costs from community interviews, a hospital-based study obtained details of private expenditures for hospitalised children under the age of 5.                                                                                                                                                                                    Results:Severe febrile illness is strongly associated with health facility attendance (OR: 35.76, 95%CI: 3.68-347.43, p = 0.002 compared with less severe febrile illness). Overall, the private costs of an illness for patients who went to a hospital were six times larger than private costs of controls ($5.68 vs. $0.90, p<0.0001). Household wealth was not significantly correlated with total costs incurred. The separate hospital based cost study indicated that private costs were three times greater for admissions at the mission versus public hospital: $13.68 mission vs. $4.47 public hospital (difference $ 9.21 (95% CI: 7.89 -10.52), p<0.0001). In both locations, approximately 50% of the cost was determined by the duration of admission, with each day in hospital increasing private costs by about 12% (95% CI: 5% - 21%).

Despite their importance, there are few reports on the epidemiology of these diseases in Tanzania, and the true burden of such illnesses remains unknown. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of leptospirosis, brucellosis, typhoid fever and urinary tract infections and their rate of co-infections with malaria.                                                                                                                    METHODS:A cross-sectional study was conducted at Kilosa district hospital in Tanzania for 6 months. Febrile children aged from 2-13 years were recruited from the outpatient department. Patients were screened by serological tests such as IgM and IgG ELISA, and microscopic agglutination test.                                                                                                                RESULTS:A total of 370 patients were enrolled; of these 85 (23.0%) had malaria parasites, 43 (11.6%) had presumptive acute leptospirosis and 26/200 (13%) had confirmed leptospirosis. Presumptive acute brucellosis due to B. abortus was identified among 26 (7.0%) of patients while B. melitensis was detected in 57 (15.4%) of the enrolled patients. Presumptive typhoid fever due to S. Typhi was identified in thirty eight (10.3%) of the participants and 69 (18.6%) had urinary tract infections. Patients presented with similar symptoms; therefore, the identification of these diseases could not be done based on clinical ground alone. Co-infections between malaria and bacterial febrile illnesses were observed in 146 patients (39.5%). Although antibacterials and/or anti-malarials were prescribed in most patients, some patients did not receive the appropriate treatment                                                                      CONCLUSION:The study has underscored the importance of febrile bacterial diseases including zoonoses such as leptospirosis and brucellosis in febrile children, and thus such illnesses should be considered by clinicians in the differential diagnoses of febrile diseases. However, access to diagnostic tests for discrimination of febrile illnesses is needed. This would allow febrile patients to receive the correct diagnoses and facilitation of accurate and prompt treatment."

METHODS: A three-arm stratified cluster-randomised trial was conducted in 36 primary healthcare facilities from September 2010 to March 2012 within two rural districts in northeast Tanzania where malaria transmission has been declining. Interventions were guided by formative mixed-methods research and were introduced in phases. Prescribing staff from all facilities received standard Ministry of Health RDT training. Prescribers from facilities in the health worker (HW) and health worker-patient (HWP) arms further participated in small interactive peer-group training sessions with the HWP additionally receiving clinic posters and patient leaflets. Performance feedback and motivational mobile-phone text messaging (SMS) were added to the HW and HWP arms in later phases. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a non-severe, non-malarial illness incorrectly prescribed a (recommended) antimalarial. Secondary outcomes investigated RDT uptake, adherence to results, and antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS: Standard RDT training reduced pre-trial levels of antimalarial prescribing, which was sustained throughout the trial. Both interventions significantly lowered incorrect prescribing of recommended antimalarials from 8% (749/8,942) in the standard training arm to 2% (250/10,118) in the HW arm (adjusted RD (aRD) 4%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1% to 6%; P?=?0.008) and 2% (184/10,163) in the HWP arm (aRD 4%; 95% CI 1% to 6%; P?=?0.005). Small group training and SMS were incrementally effective. There was also a significant reduction in the prescribing of antimalarials to RDT-negatives but no effect on RDT-positives receiving an ACT. Antibiotic prescribing was significantly lower in the HWP arm but had increased in all arms compared with pre-trial levels.nCONCLUSIONS: Small group training with SMS was associated with an incremental and sustained improvement in prescriber adherence to RDT results and reducing over-prescribing of antimalarials to close to zero. These interventions may become increasingly important to cope with the wider range of diagnostic and treatment options for patients with acute febrile illness in Africa.

We did this phase 2b study of bactericidal activity-defined as the decrease in colony forming units (CFUs) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum of patients with microscopy smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis-at eight sites in South Africa and Tanzania. We enrolled treatment-naive patients with drug-susceptible, pulmonary tuberculosis, who were randomly assigned by computer-generated sequences to receive either 8 weeks of moxifloxacin, 100 mg pretomanid (formerly known as PA-824), and pyrazinamide (MPa100Z regimen); moxifloxacin, 200 mg pretomanid, and pyrazinamide (MPa200Z regimen); or the current standard care for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis, isoniazid, rifampicin, PZA, and ethambutol (HRZE regimen). A group of patients with MDR tuberculosis received MPa200Z (DRMPa200Z group). The primary outcome was bactericidal activity measured by the mean daily rate of reduction in M tuberculosis CFUs per mL overnight sputum collected once a week, with joint Bayesian non-linear mixed-effects regression modelling. We also assessed safety and tolerability by monitoring adverse events. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01498419. Between March 24, 2012, and July 26, 2013 we enrolled 207 patients and randomly assigned them to treatment groups; we assigned 60 patients to the MPa100Z regimen, 62 to the MPa200Z regimen, and 59 to the HRZE regimen. We non-randomly assigned 26 patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis to the DRMPa200Z regimen. In patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis, the bactericidal activity of MPa200Z (n=54) on days 0-56 (0·155, 95% Bayesian credibility interval 0·133-0·178) was significantly greater than for HRZE (n=54, 0·112, 0·093-0·131). DRMPa200Z (n=9) had bactericidal activity of 0·117 (0·070-0·174). The bactericidal activity on days 7-14 was strongly associated with bactericidal activity on days 7-56. Frequencies of adverse events were similar to standard treatment in all groups. The most common adverse event was hyperuricaemia in 59 (29%) patients (17 [28%] patients in MPa100Z group, 17 [27%] patients in MPa200Z group, 17 [29%] patients. in HRZE group, and 8 [31%] patients in DRMPa200Z group). Other common adverse events were nausea in (14 [23%] patients in MPa100Z group, 8 [13%] patients in MPa200Z group, 7 [12%] patients in HRZE group, and 8 [31%] patients in DRMPa200Z group) and vomiting (7 [12%] patients in MPa100Z group, 7 [11%] patients in MPa200Z group, 7 [12%] patients in HRZE group, and 4 [15%] patients in DRMPa200Z group). No on-treatment electrocardiogram occurrences of corrected QT interval more than 500 ms (an indicator of potential of ventricular tachyarrhythmia) were reported. No phenotypic resistance developed to any of the drugs in the regimen. The combination of moxifloxacin, pretomanid, and pyrazinamide, was safe, well tolerated, and showed superior bactericidal activity in drug-susceptible tuberculosis during 8 weeks of treatment. Results were consistent between drug-susceptible and MDR tuberculosis. This new regimen is ready to enter phase 3 trials in patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis and MDR-tuberculosis, with the goal of shortening and simplifying treatment.

Mainstream economic analyses of this practice primarily conceptualise transactional sex in the language of rational choice, with the focus on behavioural decisions that women make over whether to engage in transactional interactions (or not). However, whilst providing some important insights in relation to the role of poverty and the importance of acknowledging that women are more than passive agents, these approaches fail to address the social and economic complexities of this practice that are reflected in the broader literature. Further, due to the technical framework used, there is a failure to deal with the broader socio-economic and historical underpinnings of this practice. Using evidence from fieldwork undertaken in Tanzania, the authors revisit the economics of transactional sex, and offer an alternative economic approach to understanding this practice. They explore the notion that transactional sex is an established local sexual norm, and how this norm is creatively applied and reapplied in a range of situations by different actors, including through participation in local value chains. Their analysis has a number of implications for future prevention efforts that differ from the current focus on microfinance as a means of empowering women.

The first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) regimen consists of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, and correct management reduces risk of TB relapse and development of drug resistance. In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of standard of care plus nutritional supplementation versus standard care on the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol among sputum smear positive TB patients with and without HIV. In a clinical trial in 100 Tanzanian TB patients, with or without HIV infection, drug concentrations were determined at 1 week and 2 months post initiation of anti-TB medication. Data was analysed using population pharmacokinetic modelling. The effect of body size was described using allometric scaling, and the effects of nutritional supplementation, HIV, age, sex, CD4+ count, weight-adjusted dose, NAT2 genotype, and time on TB treatment were investigated. The kinetics of all drugs was well characterised using first-order elimination and transit compartment absorption, with isoniazid and ethambutol described by two-compartment disposition models, and pyrazinamide by a one-compartment model. Patients with a slow NAT2 genotype had higher isoniazid exposure and a lower estimate of oral clearance (15.5 L/h) than rapid/intermediate NAT2 genotype (26.1 L/h). Pyrazinamide clearance had an estimated typical value of 3.32 L/h, and it was found to increase with time on treatment, with a 16.3% increase after the first 2 months of anti-TB treatment. The typical clearance of ethambutol was estimated to be 40.7 L/h, and was found to decrease with age, at a rate of 1.41% per year. Neither HIV status nor nutritional supplementations were found to affect the pharmacokinetics of these drugs in our cohort of patients."

In order to better understand the ongoing changes in vector-parasite dynamics in the area, and to allow for appropriate adjustment of control activities, the present study examined the composition, and malaria and lymphatic filarial infection, of sibling species of the Anopheles funestus group. Similar to the An. gambiae complex, the An. funestus group contains important vectors of both malaria and lymphatic filariasis. Archived (from 2005–2012) and newly collected (from 2014) specimens of the An. funestus group collected indoors using CDC light traps in villages in northeastern Tanzania were analysed. They were identified to sibling species by PCR based on amplification of species-specific nucleotide sequence in the ITS2 region on rDNA genes. The specimens were furthermore examined for infection with Plasmodium falciparum and Wuchereria bancrofti by PCR. The identified sibling species were An. funestus s.s., Anopheles parensis, Anopheles rivulorum, and Anopheles leesoni, with the first being by far the most common (overall 94.4%). When comparing archived specimens from 2005–2007 to those from 2008–2012, a small but statistically significant decrease in proportion of An. funestus s.s. was noted, but otherwise observed temporal changes in sibling species composition were minor. No P. falciparum was detected in archived specimens, while 8.3% of the newly collected An. funestus s.s. were positive for this parasite. The overall W. bancrofti infection rate decreased from 14.8% in the 2005–2007 archived specimens to only 0.5% in the newly collected specimens, and with overall 93.3% of infections being in An. funestus s.s. The study indicated that the composition of the An. funestus group had remained rather stable during the study period, with An. funestus s.s. being the most predominant. The study also showed increasing P. falciparum infection and decreasing W. bancrofti infection in An. funestus s.s. in the study period, most likely reflecting infection levels with these parasites in the human population in the area"

Consenting adult volunteers were randomized into two groups to receive either ivermectin or placebo. Twenty four hours after treatment, one volunteer from each group was concurrently exposed to 50 laboratory reared An. gambiae on one arm and 50 laboratory reared Cx. quinquefasciatus on the other arm for 15-30 minutes. Engorged mosquitoes were maintained on 10% glucose solution for 12 days and observed for survival and fecundity. The experiment was repeated 15 times. Two days after the blood meals, nearly half (average 47.7% for the 15 experiments) of the blood fed An. gambiae in the ivermectin group had died while almost all in the placebo group were alive (97.2%), and the difference in survival between these two groups continued to widen on the following days. There was no clear effect of ivermectin on Cx. quinquefasciatus, which had high survival in both ivermectin and placebo group on day 2 (95.7% and 98.4%, respectively) as well as on the following days. Ivermectin completely inhibited egg laying in An. gambiae, while egg laying and subsequent development of immature stages appeared normal in the other three groups. Blood meals taken on ivermectin treated volunteers significantly reduced survival and halted fecundity of An. gambiae but had only limited or no effect on Cx. quinquefasciatus. The result suggests that widespread use of ivermectin may have contributed to the observed decline in density of An. gambiae, without similar decrease in Cx. quinquefasciatus, in north-eastern Tanzania."

CAA was eluted from blood spots collected from 19 individuals onto Whatman 903 cards in Mwanza, Tanzania, and the assay was optimized to achieve CAA ratios comparable to those obtained from the spots' corresponding serum samples. The optimized assay was then used to determine the correlation of serum samples (n=16) with DBS from cards that had been stored for 8 years at ambient temperature.Using a DBS volume equivalent to approximately four times the quantity of serum, CAA testing in DBS had a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 79% compared to CAA testing in serum. CAA testing was reliable in samples eluted from Whatman 903 cards that had been stored for 8 years at ambient temperature. The overall kappa coefficient was 0.53 (standard error 0.17, p<0.001). We conclude that CAA can be reliably and accurately measured in DBS collected onto the filter paper that is most commonly used for clinical care and research, and that can be stored from prolonged periods of time. This finding opens new avenues for future work among more than 700 million individuals living in areas worldwide in which schistosomes are endemic. "

They reported being the first port of call for adolescents seeking reproductive health services, but their knowledge of ARH needs was poor. They had negative attitudes to, and lacked the necessary resources for, the provision of such services for adolescents. Some were particularly unwilling to provide condom services and were prejudiced against adolescents using them. There was poor integration between the close-to-community providers and the formal health sector, further limiting their ability to provide adequate services.                                                                                       Conclusions: Although close-to-community providers are considered a key resource in the community, most have limited capacity to provide ARH services. Without capacity-building investments such as training and cooperation with the mainstream health sector, their contribution to positive reproductive health outcomes is limited, or could indeed lead to adverse outcomes."

Participants were 1,815 ART-naïve non-pregnant adults with body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2 who were referred for ART based on CD4 count <350 cells/?L or WHO stage 3 or 4 disease. The intervention was a lipid-based nutritional supplement either without (LNS) or with additional vitamins and minerals (LNS-VM), beginning prior to ART initiation; supplement amounts were 30 g/day (150 kcal) from recruitment until 2 weeks after starting ART and 250 g/day (1,400 kcal) from weeks 2 to 6 after starting ART. The primary outcome was mortality between recruitment and 12 weeks of ART.

The intervention did not affect SAEs or BMI, but decreased the incidence of low serum phosphate (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.97; P = 0.03) and increased the incidence of high serum potassium (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.19-2.15; P = 0.002) and phosphate (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10-1.37; P <0.001). Mean CD4 count at 12 weeks post-ART was 25 cells/?L (95% CI, 4-46) higher in the LNS-VM compared to the LNS arm (P = 0.02). High-dose vitamin and mineral supplementation in LNS, compared to LNS alone, did not decrease mortality or clinical SAEs in malnourished African adults initiating ART, but improved CD4 count. The higher frequency of elevated serum potassium and phosphate levels suggests high-level electrolyte supplementation for all patients is inadvisable but the addition of micronutrient supplements to ART may provide clinical benefits in these patients.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 4 groups of young people aged 15-24 years old (secondary school students, college/university students, employees of local industries and casual labourers) in two regions (Kilimanjaro and Mwanza) of northern Tanzania. Using a multistage stratified random sampling strategy, we collected information on demographics, alcohol use, and behavioural factors. We screened severity of alcohol use using the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and estimated the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption using the timeline-follow-back-calendar (TLFB) method.                                                                                                                                                                          RESULTS: A total of 1954 young people were surveyed. The prevalence of reported alcohol use was higher among males (47-70% ever users and 20-45% current users) than females (24-54% ever users and 12-47% current users). Prevalence of use was substantially higher in Kilimanjaro than Mwanza region. In both regions, participants reported high exposure to alcohol advertisements, and wide alcohol availability. College students reported the highest prevalence of current alcohol use (45% among males; 26% among females) and of heavy episodic drinking (71% among males; 27% among females) followed by casual labourers. Males were more likely to have AUD (an AUDIT score ?8) than females, with 11-28% of males screening positive for AUD. Alcohol use was associated with male gender, being in a relationship, greater disposable income, non-Muslim religion and a higher number of sexual partners.

Blood was assayed for PEth (16:0/18:1-subform) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The MINI dependence criteria (?3 positive responses) were met by 39% participants although their PEth levels were low. Contrary, many young people with high PEth levels were not classified as dependent. The sensitivity of the MINI ranged from 0% to 69% (female students and male workers, respectively) and specificity from 52% to 85% (workers and female students, respectively). The highest AUROC (0.68) occurred with a cut-off of ?4 positive responses. A modified MINI with three affirmative responses to five questions increased specificity to 92%-97%; however, sensitivity remained low. The performance of the MINI in detecting dependence among young people from northern-Tanzania is unsatisfactory. Specificity was improved using a modified version but sensitivity remained low. An accurate tool for the diagnosis of alcohol dependence is needed for epidemiological and clinical purposes."

We compared these instruments with the alcohol biomarker phosphatidylethanol (PEth) among young-people in northern Tanzania.                                                                                             METHODS: AUDIT and TLFB were applied in a cross-sectional study of 202 young people (18-24 years), who reported using alcohol during the past year (103 male casual labourers; 99 college students). We assayed whole blood for PEth 16:0/18:1, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.                                                                                                             RESULTS: For both self-report methods, alcohol consumption was high, particularly among men (e.g. a median of 54 drinks per month in labourers), and about half of male students (48%) reported hazardous or harmful levels of drinking (AUDIT ?8). Almost half (49%) of participants were PEth-positive (median concentration 0.03?mol/L). There were significant positive correlations between reported total alcohol intake and PEth concentration in males (Spearman's correlation rs=0.65 in college students and rs=0.57 in casual labourers; p<0.001). Self-reported use in the past month was a sensitive marker of having a positive PEth result (?0.01?mol/L) with 89% of those with a PEth positive result reporting alcohol use, and this was similar in all groups. The proportion of those with AUDIT scores ?8 and AUDIT-C scores ?6 among those with a high cut-off positive PEth result (?0.30?mol/L) ranged between 94 and 100%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CONCLUSION: TLFB and AUDIT are sensitive measures to detect heavy alcohol use among young-people in northern Tanzania. They can be used to identify young people who may benefit from alcohol-focused interventions"

Artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT) is currently the key first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Plasmodium falciparum genetic signatures at pfmdr-1, pfcrt, and pfubp-1 loci are known to modulate in vivo and in vitro parasite response to ACT. The objective of this study was to assess the distribution of these resistance gene markers in isolates collected from different malaria transmission intensity in Ethiopia and Tanzania. Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates were collected from different regions of Ethiopia and Tanzania. Genetic polymorphisms in the genes pfcrt, pfmdr-1 and pfubp-1 were analysed by PCR and sequencing. Frequencies of the different alleles in the three genes were compared within and between regions, and between the two countries. The majority of the isolates from Ethiopia were mutant for the pfcrt 76 and wild-type for pfmdr-1 86. In contrast, the majority of the Tanzanian samples were wild-type for both pfcrt and pfmdr-1 loci. Analysis of a variable linker region in pfmdr-1 showed substantial variation in isolates from Tanzania as compared to Ethiopian isolates that had minimal variation. Direct sequencing of the pfubp-1 region showed that 92.8% (26/28) of the Ethiopian isolates had identical genome sequence with the wild type reference P. falciparum strain 3D7. Of 42 isolates from Tanzania, only 13 (30.9%) had identical genome sequences with 3D7. In the Tanzanian samples, 10 variant haplotypes were identified. The majority of Ethiopian isolates carried the main marker for chloroquine (CQ) resistance, while the majority of the samples from Tanzania carried markers for CQ susceptibility. Polymorphic genes showed substantially more variation in Tanzanian isolates. The low variability in the polymorphic region of pfmdr-1 in Ethiopia may be a consequence of low transmission intensity as compared to high transmission intensity and large variations in Tanzania"

Kisesa-resident women who tested HIV-positive during HIV serosurveillance and were pregnant (while HIV-positive) between 2005 and 2012 were eligible. Community cohort records were linked to PMTCT and HIV clinic data from four facilities (PMTCT programme implemented in 2009; referrals to city-based hospitals since 2005) to ascertain service use. Factors associated with access to HIV care and ARVs during pregnancy were analysed using logistic regression. Overall, 24% of women accessed HIV care and 12% accessed ARVs during pregnancy (n=756 pregnancies to 420 women); these proportions increased over time. In multivariate analyses for 2005-2012, being married, prior voluntary counselling and testing, increasing age, increasing year of pregnancy and increasing duration of infection were independently associated with access to care and ARVs. Residence in roadside areas was an independent predictor of access to care but not ARVs. There was no evidence of an interaction with time period. Access to PMTCT services was low in this rural setting but improved markedly over time. There were fairly few sociodemographic differentials although support for young women and those without partners may be needed. Further decentralisation of HIV services to more remote areas, promotion of voluntary counselling and testing and implementation of Option B+ are likely to improve uptake and may bring women into care and treatment sooner after infection.

Soluble EPCR (sEPCR) inhibits binding of P. falciparum to EPCR in vitro and increased levels of sEPCR have been associated with the H3 haplotype of the EPCR encoding PROCR gene. It has been hypothesized that elevated sEPCR levels, possibly linked to the PROCR H3 genetic variant, may confer protection against severe forms of malaria. This study determined the frequencies of PROCR haplotypes H1–4 and plasma levels of sEPCR in a Tanzanian study population to investigate a possible association with severe malaria. Study participants were children under 5 years of age admitted at the Korogwe District Hospital (N = 143), and diagnosed as having severe malaria (N = 52; including cerebral malaria N = 17), uncomplicated malaria (N = 24), or an infection other than malaria (N = 67). In addition, blood samples from 71 children living in nearby villages were included. The SNPs defining the haplotypes of PROCR gene were determined by post-PCR ligation detection reaction-fluorescent microsphere assay. Individuals carrying at least one H3 allele had significantly higher levels of sEPCR than individuals with no H3 alleles (P < 0.001). No difference in the frequency of H3 was found between the non-malaria patients, malaria patients or the village population (P > 0.1). Plasma levels of sEPCR differed between these three groups, with higher sEPCR levels in the village population compared to the hospitalized patients (P < 0.001) and higher levels in malaria patients compared to non-malaria patients (P = 0.001). However, no differences were found in the distribution of H3 (P = 0.2) or levels of sEPCR (P = 0.8) between patients diagnosed with severe and uncomplicated malaria. Frequencies of SNPs determining PROCR haplotypes were in concordance with other African studies. The PROCR H3 allele was associated with higher levels of sEPCR, confirming earlier findings, however, in this Tanzanian population; neither PROCR haplotype nor level of sEPCR was associated with severe malaria, however, larger studies are needed to confirm these findin"

To address this gap we conducted a study of mRDT-negative fever aetiologies among children and adults in Tanzania. Methods: 1028 patients aged 3 months to 50 years with a febrile illness and negative mRDT were enrolled from a Tanzanian hospital outpatient department. All had a physical examination and cultures from blood, nasopharynx/throat and urine. Patients were followed on Days 7 and 14 and children meeting WHO criteria for pneumonia were followed on Day 2 with chest radiology. Results: Respiratory symptoms were the most frequent presenting complaint, reported by 20.3% of adults and 64.0% (339/530) of children. Of 38 X-rayed children meeting WHO pneumonia criteria 47.4% had a normal X-ray. Overall only 1.3% of 1028 blood cultures were positive. Salmonella typhi was the most prevalent pathogen isolated (7/13, 53.8%) and S. typhi patients reported fever for a median of 7 days (range 2-14). Children with bacteraemia did not present with WHO symptoms requiring antibiotic treatment. Young children and adults had similar prevalences of positive urine cultures (24/428 and 29/498, respectively). Conclusion: Few outpatient fevers are caused by blood stream bacterial infection and most adult bacteraemia would be identified by current clinical guidelines although paediatric bacteraemia may be more difficult to diagnose. While pneumonia may be over-diagnosed, urinary tract infection was relatively common. Our results emphasise the difficulty in identifying African children in need of antibiotics among the majority who do not. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

We enrolled 403 pregnant adolescent girls from 10 antenatal clinics near Mwanza, Tanzania. Girls answered structured interviews about sexual health and risk factors and were tested for six common STIs. 199 girls (49.4%) had at least one STI. Herpes Simplex Virus- Type 2 was most prevalent (139 girls, 34.5%), followed by trichomoniasis (54 girls, 13.4%), chlamydia (46 girls, 11.4%), gonorrhoea (27 girls, 6.7%), syphilis (21 girls, 5.2%) and HIV (30 girls, 4.7%). Of note, 53/199 (26.6%) of girls with laboratory-proven STIs were asymptomatic. On multivariable analysis, the presence of any STI was associated with being in a long-term (as opposed to short-term) relationship (OR=2.6 (1.4 to 4.9) p=0.004), younger age at first sexual debut (OR=0.9 per year (0.8 to 0.99), p=0.034), increasing age difference between the girl and her partner (OR=1.1 (1.0 to 1.1) per year, p=0.03) and history of prior pregnancy (OR=1.6 (1.0 to 2.6), p=0.04). STIs affected half of rural pregnant adolescents in Tanzania. Our work demonstrates the urgent need to incorporate routine STI testing into antenatal care in Tanzania to prevent morbidity and mortality in young girls and their babies.

Culture and drug susceptibility test of the isolates was performed at the institute of medical microbiology and epidemiology of infectious diseases, University hospital, Leipzig, Germany. Data on the patient's characteristics were obtained from structured questionnaire administered to the patients who gave informed verbal consent. Unadjusted bivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the risk factors for drug resistant-TB. The significance level was determined at P < 0.05. Results:The overall proportions of any drug resistance and MDR-TB were 12.7% and 6.3% respectively. The prevalence of any drug resistance and MDR-TB among new cases were 11.4% and 4.3% respectively, whereas among previously treated cases was 22.2% respectively. Previously treated patients were more likely to develop anti-TB drug resistance. There was no association between anti-TB drug resistances (including MDR-TB) with the risk factors analysed. Conclusions: High proportions of anti-TB drug resistance among new and previously treated cases observed in this study suggest that, additional efforts still need to be done in identifying individual cases at facility-base level for improved TB control programmes and drug resistance survey should continuously be monitored in the country."

",Co-Author,,,,,"Background: In Tanzania HIV Testing and Counselling (HTC) is being implemented through voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), provider initiated counselling and testing (PITC) and work place counselling and testing (HTC). Within these programmes, HIV status disclosure is emphasized. However, among persons who test HIV positive, many do not disclose their status to their partners and social networks. However, data are lacking on the effectiveness of the different HTC strategies on HIV positive status disclosure. Objective: To investigate which of the three HIV Testing and Counselling (HTC) strategies: Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT), Provider Initiated Counselling and Testing (PITC) and work place Counselling and testing is associated with improved HIV-positive status disclosure in Eastern Tanzania. Methods: Structured interviews were conducted with 455 newly diagnosed HIV-positive clients at 6 HTC sites during enrolment and at three months follow-up to collect data on disclosure status. Results: We found that PITC strategy attended a relatively higher proportion of clients 182/455(40.1%) as compared to VCT 169/455 (37.1%) and work place HTC strategies 104/455(22.9%) respectively. Among clients, about one third 130/455(28.6%) were found to be HIV-positive. HIV status disclosure rates were variable and were in order of preference of disclosing to family members 86/130(66.2 %), followed by relatives 74/130(56.9%) and sexual partners 71/130(54.6%). A high proportion of participants 77/130(59.2%) experienced violence acts from sexual partners in form of stigma and discrimination, abuse, divorce and termination from employment. In the multivariate logistic regression, disclosure to sexual partners was associated with violence acts of about two times higher (Disclosure to Partners OR=1.89) when compared to the group that did not disclose to their partners. Conclusion: PITC strategy was found to result into higher rates of HIV positive status disclosure when compared to VCT and work place HTC strategies. Stigma, discrimination and violence acts are still prevalent in Tanzania and discourages HIV positive status disclosure.

As mosquito infection rates can be low, a method for collecting large numbers of mosquitoes is necessary. Gravid traps collected large numbers of Culex quinquefasciatus in Tanzania, and a collection method that targets mosquitoes that have already fed could result in increased sensitivity in detecting W. bancrofti-infected mosquitoes. The aim of this experiment was to test this hypothesis by comparing U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps with CDC gravid traps in northeastern Tanzania, where Cx. quinquefasciatus is a vector of lymphatic filariasis. After an initial study where small numbers of mosquitoes were collected, a second study collected 16,316 Cx. quinquefasciatus in 60 gravid trap-nights and 240 light trap-nights. Mosquitoes were pooled and tested for presence of W. bancrofti DNA. Light and gravid traps collected similar numbers of mosquitoes per trap-night, but the physiological status of the mosquitoes was different. The estimated infection rate in mosquitoes collected in light traps was considerably higher than in mosquitoes collected in gravid traps, so light traps can be a useful tool for xenomonitoring work in Tanzania."

Malnourished patients (n 1815) were recruited at referral to antiretroviral therapy (ART) into a two-stage nutritional rehabilitation programme, randomised to receive a lipid-based nutrient supplement with or without added micronutrients. Fe was included in the intervention arm during the second stage, given from 2 to 6 weeks post-ART. Hb, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) were measured at recruitment and 6 weeks post-ART. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the impact of the intervention, and the effect of reducing inflammation from recruitment to week 6 on Hb and Fe status. There was no effect of the intervention on Hb, serum ferritin, sTfR or serum CRP. A one-log decrease of serum CRP from recruitment to week 6 was associated with a 1.81 g/l increase in Hb (95% CI 0.85, 2.76; P< 0.001), and a 0.11 log decrease in serum ferritin (95% CI - 0.22, 0.03; P= 0.012) from recruitment to week 6. There was no association between the change in serum CRP and the change in sTfR over the same time period (P= 0.78). In malnourished, HIV-infected adults receiving dietary Fe, a reduction in inflammation in the early ART treatment period appears to be a precondition for recovery from anaemia."

In order to interrupt transmission, 4–6 rounds of MDA are required with at least 60–70% minimum effective coverage. Children born since the introduction of the MDA programme are recommended for assessing the interruption of transmission. The objective of this study was lymphatic filariasis transmission status after nine rounds of MDA in Rufiji district, Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Methods: This cross sectional survey involved 270 heads of household. Parents or guardians were interviewed on behalf of the schoolchildren about their participation in MDA programme. Status of LF prevalence was assessed by measuring Wuchereria bancrofti circulating filarial antigens (CFA) in blood samples from standard one school children (6 – 9 years using immunochromatographic test cards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Results: A total of 413 standard one schoolchildren were tested for CFA; 59 (14.3%) had CFA. Two thirds (66.8%) of the children did not participate in 2011 MDA round. Prevalence of CFA was significantly lower in younger (6.4%) than older children (40.4%) (p<0.05). Participation in the last (2011) MDA did not significantly change the prevalence W. bancrofti CFA (?2 = 0.723, p=0.4). The recorded MDA coverage for 5 years including 2011 was above the 60–70 % minimum effective coverage. The community reported coverage was 40.4% for last MDA (2011), for previous MDAs was 53.0%; being far below the minimum effective coverage. Though the large majority (97.0%) of households had heard of LF, only about half (57.0%) knew it was transmitted by mosquitoes. Less than a half (43.6%) of households were aware of the adverse effects of LF, therefore motivated to participate in MDA.                                       Conclusion: The findings indicate that LF transmission has continued in Rufiji district despite nine rounds of MDA. Low compliance to MDAs due to community and programmatic factors were responsible for the continued LF transmission. Detailed entomological studies are required to establish LF transmission dynamics and the programmatic factors associated with MDA implementation in the area."

Total 388 adults from Kome Islands (about 50 people from each village) aged between 12 and 85 years, were examined by abdominal ultrasound according to the Niamey protocol. Liver image patterns (LIPs) A and B were considered normal, and C-F as distinct periportal fibrosis (PPF). The overall prevalence of PPF was 42.2%; much higher in males than in females (47.0% in male vs 34.4% in females, P=0.007). Abnormal increase of segmental branch wall thickness (SBWT) and dilated portal vein diameter (PVD) were also more common in males than in females. Hepatosplenomegaly was frequently encountered; 68.1% had left liver lobe hepatomegaly and 55.2% had splenomegaly. Schistosoma mansoni-related morbidity is quite high among adults in this community justifying the implementation of integrated control strategies through mass drug administration, improved water supply (pumped wells), and health education that had already started in the study area."

Baseline surveys for schistosomiasis and STHs was conducted before implementation of any integrated control strategies, followed by 4 cross-sectional follow-up surveys on randomly selected samples of schoolchildren and adults in 10 primary schools and 8 villages, respectively, on Kome islands. Those follow-up surveys were conducted for impact evaluation after introduction of control strategies interventions in the study area. Five rounds of MDA have been implemented from 2009 along with PHAST and improved water supply with pumped wells as other control strategies for complementing MDA. A remarkable steady decline of schistosomiasis and STHs was observed from 2009 to 2012 with significant trends in their prevalence decline, and thereafter infection rate has remained at a low sustainable control. By the third follow-up survey in 2012, Schistosoma mansoni infection prevalence was reduced by 90.5% and hookworm by 93.3% among schoolchildren while in adults the corresponding reduction was 83.2% and 56.9%, respectively. Integrated control strategies have successfully reduced S. mansoni and STH infection status to a lower level. This study further suggests that monitoring and evaluation is a crucial component of any large-scale STH and schistosomiasis intervention."

Numerous reports have suggested plant extracts and their constituents as possible anti-inflammatory agents. Here, in vitro evidence of Ocimum labiatum's immune-enhancing and antioxidant properties is presented for the first time. The anti-inflammatory effect of O. labiatum ethanolic extract and an isolated diterpenoid was determined using a cytometric bead array (CBA) technique. The effect on phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was also assessed. A battery of antioxidant assays were used for detecting antioxidant activity while the anti-inflammatory mechanism was evaluated using an ELISA-based activator protein (AP-1) (c-Jun) assay. Cytotoxicity was determined on TZM-bl and PBMCs using a tetrazolium dye and confirmed by a novel label-free real-time assay. A 25 ?g/mL non-cytotoxic concentration of O. labiatum extract significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-17A. Except for the dual acting pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, which was upregulated, a non-cytotoxic 50 ?M concentration of the isolated labdane diterpenoid compound significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the production of all the pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the anti-inflammatory pathway studies, the compound also inhibited AP-1 significantly (p < 0.05) at 50 ?M. The extract demonstrated strong, dose dependent antioxidant activity with IC50 values ranging from 13 ± 0.8 to 54.86 ± 1.28 ?g/mL while the terpene had no antioxidant property. The extract and diterpenoid decreased the production of the inflammatory mediator NO, at non-cytotoxic concentrations. The CC50 of the extract in TZM-bl and PBMCs was 62.6 ± 0.6 and 30.1 ± 0.4 ?g/mL while that of the compound was 112.6 ± 0.2 and 70 ± 0.4 ?M respectively. The real time studies confirmed tetrazolium dye assessed viability and also detected a unique growth pattern for the plant materials compared to untreated cells. O. labiatum extract demonstrated promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties while the terpenoid showed anti-inflammatory but no antioxidant activity. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of the terpene was a result of inhibition of AP-1. These data represents promising first steps towards the development of naturally derived anti-inflammation drugs."

The crow is responsible for polluting the environment, water sources and human surroundings by their droppings and the rubbish they carry. This behavior has led to concern that, the crows may be responsible for the spread of certain pathogens including Salmonella and their persistence in the environment.Given the zoonotic potential of Salmonella, the main aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella infections in Indian house crows and to determine if the isolates were similar to those associated with disease in livestock or humans. Methods: Indian house crows were lured with meat and blood baits to land into the crow live-trap set at the Mabibo compound of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in Dar es Salaam city in Tanzania. A total of 100 house crows were captured, humanely sacrificed, and their small and large intestines were obtained by using aseptic techniques for microbiological investigations. Culture technique was employed to detect the presence of Salmonella in intestinal contents; and preliminary identification of the isolates was based on colonial characteristics on selective media and microscopic examination of smears following Gram staining. Confirmation of Salmonella species was done by biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by using the disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar. Results and Discussion: Eight isolates were identified by standard microbiological techniques as Salmonella spp. (6 suggestive of Salmonella gallinarum and 2 suggestive of S. Typhi). All isolates were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin but resistant to amoxicillin. Lower levels of susceptibility were noted for chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone. Our results demonstrate the presence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella spp. in the Indian house crows’ population and provide an indication of potential public and poultry health risks associated with these birds in the coastal area. Conclusion: The occurrence of antibiotic resistant S. Typhi and S. gallinarum among Indian house crows has both veterinary and public health consequences as they may be transmitted to poultry and humans. This therefore provides further rationale for the public action on eradicating the house crows."

We determined the prevalence of selected NCDs and HIV infection, and NCD risk factors in northwestern Tanzania and southern Uganda. A population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted, enrolling households using multistage sampling with five strata per country (one municipality, two towns, two rural areas). Consenting adults (?18 years) were interviewed using the WHO STEPS survey instrument, examined, and tested for HIV and diabetes mellitus (DM). Adjusting for survey design, we estimated population prevalences of hypertension, DM, obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac failure, epilepsy and HIV, and investigated factors associated with hypertension using logistic regression. Across strata, hypertension prevalence ranged from 16 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 12 % to 22 %) to 17 % (CI: 14 % to 22 %) in Tanzania, and from 19 % (CI: 14 % to 26 %) to 26 % (CI: 23 % to 30 %) in Uganda. It was high in both urban and rural areas, affecting many young participants. The prevalence of DM (1 % to 4 %) and other NCDs was generally low. HIV prevalence ranged from 6 % to 10 % in Tanzania, and 6 % to 12 % in Uganda. Current smoking was reported by 12 % to 23 % of men in different strata, and 1 % to 3 % of women. Problem drinking (defined by Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test criteria) affected 6 % to 15 % men and 1 % to 6 % women. Up to 46 % of participants were overweight, affecting women more than men and urban more than rural areas. Most patients with hypertension and other NCDs were unaware of their condition, and hypertension in treated patients was mostly uncontrolled. Hypertension was associated with older age, male sex, being divorced/widowed, lower education, higher BMI and, inversely, with smoking. The high prevalence of NCD risk factors and unrecognized and untreated hypertension represent major problems. The low prevalence of DM and other preventable NCDs provides an opportunity for prevention. HIV prevalence was in line with national data. In Tanzania, Uganda and probably elsewhere in Africa, major efforts are needed to strengthen health services for the early detection and treatment of chronic diseases."

Contraceptive counseling during routine antenatal HIV testing could reach 97 percent of pregnant women with much-needed information, but requires an understanding of postpartum contraceptive use and its relationship to antenatal intentions. We conducted a baseline survey of reproductive behavior among 5,284 antenatal clients in Northern Tanzania, followed by an intervention offering contraceptive counseling to half the respondents. A follow-up survey at 6-15 months postpartum examined patterns and determinants of postpartum contraceptive use, assessed their correspondence with antenatal intentions, and evaluated the impact of the intervention. Despite high loss to follow-up, our findings indicate that condoms and hormonal methods had particular and distinct roles in the postpartum period, based on understandings of postpartum fertility. Antenatal intentions were poor predictors of postpartum reproductive behavior. Antenatal counseling had an effect on postpartum contraceptive intentions, but not on use. Different antenatal/contraceptive service integration models should be tested to determine how and when antenatal counseling can be most effective."

METHODS: We present data from a large controlled trial of fluid resuscitation (Fluid Expansion As Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial) on the prevalence, clinical features, and transfusion management of anaemia in children presenting to hospitals in three East African countries with serious febrile illness (predominantly malaria and/or sepsis) and impaired peripheral perfusion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RESULTS: Of 3,170 children in the FEAST trial, 3,082 (97%) had baseline haemoglobin (Hb) measurement, 2,346/3,082 (76%) were anaemic (Hb <10 g/dL), and 33% severely anaemic (Hb <5 g/dL). Prevalence of severe anaemia varied from 12% in Kenya to 41% in eastern Uganda. 1,387/3,082 (45%) children were transfused (81% within 8 hours). Adherence to WHO transfusion guidelines was poor. Among severely anaemic children who were not transfused, 52% (54/103) died within 8 hours, and 90% of these deaths occurred within 2.5 hours of randomisation. By 24 hours, 128/1,002 (13%) severely anaemic children had died, compared to 36/501 (7%) and 71/843 (8%) of those with moderate and mild anaemia, respectively. Among children without severe hypotension who were randomised to receive fluid boluses of 0.9% saline or albumin, mortality was increased (10.6% and 10.5%, respectively) compared to controls (7.2%), regardless of admission Hb level. Repeat transfusion varied from ?2% in Kenya/Tanzania to 6 to 13% at the four Ugandan centres. Adverse reactions to blood were rare (0.4%).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CONCLUSIONS: Severe anaemia complicates one third of childhood admissions with serious febrile illness to hospitals in East Africa, and is associated with increased mortality. A high proportion of deaths occurred within 2.5 hours of admission, emphasizing the need for rapid recognition and prompt blood transfusion. Adherence to current WHO transfusion guidelines was poor. The high rates of re-transfusion suggest that 20 mL/kg whole blood or 10 mL/kg packed cells may undertreat a significant proportion of anaemic children. Future evaluation of the impact of a larger volume of transfused blood and optimum transfusion management of children with Hb of <6 g/dL is warranted."

This has led to the sale of different brands of bottled water on the Tanzanian market. Due to increased demand and consumption of bottled water in Tanzania, there has been a growing concern about the microbiological quality of this product. The objective of this study was to assess the physico-chemical quality parameters and microbial contamination level with thermotolerant fecal coliform bacteria commercial bottled water Dar es Salaam city in Tanzania. Materials and Methods: This cross sectional study was done in randomly selected ten different commercial brand of bottled water available in commercial market of Dar es Salaam city in Tanzania. Tap water from Dar es Salaam Water Supply Company (DAWASCO) was also sampled for comparison. Fecal coliform were enumerated by the membrane filtration and commercial field testing DelAgua®kit. The physicochemical examination of the water samples was done to determine pH, turbidity and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) of the water samples using a Hach spectrophotometer (Hach Company, Loveland, Colorado, USA). Results and Discussion: All samples of bottled water (100%) analyzed did not show the presence of thermotolerant faecal coliform bacteria and thus meet the World Health Organization (WHO) acceptable value of zero cfu/ml. All the surveyed brands of bottled water were safe for drinking as they were devoid of any thermotolerant fecal coliforms bacteria. Tap water from DAWASCO revealed thermotolerant fecal coliforms contamination with mean CFU counts of 4.0/100ml. Coliform organisms found in tap water in this study were above the recommended levels by regulatory agencies such as Tanzania Bureau Standard (TBS), International Bottled Water Association (IBWA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), United States Environmental Protection Agency for (USEPA), World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Community (EC). The overall mean results of the physicochemical parameters of bottled water brands and tap water studied were within the recommended limits by TBS and WHO. Conclusions: The absence of thermotolerant fecal coliform bacteria in the bottled water is indicative of safety for public consumption. Tap water from DAWASCO is unfit for human consumption and it needs to be treated to render it safe for human drinking. Physicochemical parameters revealed that the pH, TDS and turbidity were within the required levels by TBS and WHO. This indicates that, the manufacturers of bottled water brands and DAWASCO are conforming to the TBS and WHO standards on physicochemical requirements for drinking water."

As a result, communities in and around mining sites are at great risk of HIV transmission. While a few unsynchronized mine-specific population-based studies provide evidence of a growing HIV problem in this sector, virtually few evidence exists on availability and quality of interventions targeting HIV and AIDS in this population. The study was conducted to assess the availability and quality of HIV/AIDS intervention programmes in and around mining sites in Tanzania. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted from November 2012 to April 2013. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect data. Study areas involved both mining sites and its surrounding communities in Kahama, Nzega and Geita Districts. It involved household members from villages in and around the mining sites, mining community relations officers, community health facility workers, district HIV/AIDS focal persons and village leaders. Results: A total of 463 individuals were recruited into the study for household interviews. In-depth interviews with Key Informants involved 15 respondents. HIV/AIDS intervention programmes in the study area were available despite that knowledge of their existence was limited to a segment of the community. Their availability was only known to about 25% of the study respondents in Geita and Kahama study sites. The programmes carried out intervention activities which included HIV/AIDS education campaigns, promoting uptake of voluntary counselling and testing services, promoting and supporting condom use, safer sex, and male circumcision. HIV/AIDS services such as screening, distribution of condoms and ARVs for infected people were available and were offered free of charge. Conclusion: Our findings show that HIV/AIDS intervention programmes were available despite that they were unequally distributed. Although their availability has contributed to the decrease of HIV prevalence in the community, knowledge of their availability was limited to some people in the community."

Sixty four (39%) knew a risk factor for mycobacterial disease. Overall, 64(39%) perceived to be at risk of mycobacterial diseases. Exposure to potential risks of mycobacterial diseases were: keeping livestock, not boiling drinking water, large family, smoking and sharing dwelling with TB patients. Rural dwellers were more often livestock keepers (p<0.01), more often shared dwelling with livestock (p<0.01) than urban dwellers. More primary school leavers reported sharing dwelling with TB patients than participants with secondary and higher education (p = 0.01). Livestock keeping, sharing dwelling with livestock, sharing household with a TB patient were perceived risk factors for mycobacterial diseases and the participants were exposed to some of these risk factors. Improving knowledge about the risk factors may protect them from these serious diseases"

Despite being a major health problem in Tanzania, screening services for cervical cancer are very limited, and uptake of those services is low. We therefore conducted a study to investigate utilization of cancer screening services, and its associated factors among female primary school teachers in Ilala Municipality, Dar es Salaam. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study between May – August 2011 which involved 110 primary schools in Ilala Municipality in Dar es Salaam. Five hundred and twelve female primary school teachers were sampled using a two-stage cluster sampling procedure. Data on utilization of cervical cancer and risk factors were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Proportional utilization of cervical cancer screening services was identified through a self report. Risk factors for services utilization were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Results: Out of 512 female primary school teachers, only 108 (21 %) reported to ever been screened for cervical cancer. Utilization of cervical cancer screening services was 28 % among those aged 20–29, 22 % among married and 24 % among those with higher level of education. Women were more likely to utilize the cancer-screening service if they were multiparous (age-adjusted OR = 3.05, 95 % CI 1.15–8.06, P value 0.025), or reported more than one lifetime sexual partner (age-adjusted OR 2.17, 95 % CI 1.04–4.54, P value 0.038), or did not involve their spouse in making health decisions (adjusted OR 3.56, 95 % CI 2.05–6.18, P value <0.001). Conclusion: The study has demonstrated low level of utilization of cervical cancer screening service among female primary school teachers in Ilala munipality. Female primary school teachers with more than one previous pregnancy and those with more than one life-time sex partners were more likely to report utilization of the service. Spouse or partners support was an important factor in the utilization of cervical cancer screening service amongst the study population."

Thus interventions to control helminth infections may have an impact on incidence of clinical malaria and anaemia. The current study assessed the impact of two anthelmintic treatment approaches on malaria infection and on anaemia in school and pre-school children in Magu district, Tanzania. Methods A total of 765 children were enrolled into a prospective randomized anthelmintic intervention trial following a baseline study of 1546 children. Enrolled children were randomized to receive either repeated treatment with praziquantel and albendazole four times a year (intervention group, 394 children) or single dose treatment with praziquantel and albendazole once a year (control group, 371 children). Follow up examinations were conducted at 12 and 24 months after baseline to assess the impact of the intervention. Stool and urine samples were collected and examined for schistosome and soil transmitted helminth infections. Blood samples were also collected and examined for malaria parasites and haemoglobin concentrations. Monitoring of clinical malaria attacks was performed at each school during the two years of the intervention. Results Out of 1546 children screened for P. falciparum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, hookworm and T. Trichiura at baseline, 1079 (69.8%) were infected with at least one of the four parasites. There was no significant difference in malaria infection (prevalence, parasite density and frequency of malaria attacks) and in the prevalence of anaemia between the repeated and single dose anthelmintic treatment groups at 12 and 24 months follow up (p > 0.05). However, overall, there was significant improvement in mean haemoglobin concentrations (p < 0.001) from baseline levels of 122.0g/L and 123.0g/L to 136.0g/L and 136.8g/L for the repeated and single dose treatment groups, respectively, at 24 months follow-up which resulted in significant reduction in prevalence of anaemia. Conclusions These results suggest that repeated anthelmintic treatment did not have an impact on malaria infection compared to single dose treatment. However, both treatment approaches had overall impact in terms of improvements of haemoglobin levels and hence reductions in prevalence of anaemia."

FINDINGS: Regional Millennium Development Goal (MDG) intervention coverage, based on 19 indicators, ranged from 47% in Shinyanga in the northwest to 71% in Dar es Salaam region. Regions in the eastern half of the country have higher coverage than in the western half of mainland. The MDG coverage score is strongly positively correlated with health systems strength (r = 0.84). Controlling for socioeconomic status in a multivariate analysis has no impact on the association between the MDG coverage score and health system strength. During 1991-2010 intervention coverage improved considerably in all regions, but the absolute gap between the regions did not change during the past two decades, with a gap of 22% between the top and bottom three regions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  INTERPRETATION: The assessment of regional progress and performance in 21 regions of mainland Tanzania showed considerable inequalities in coverage and health system strength and allowed the identification of high and low-performing regions. Using summary measures derived from administrative, health facility and survey data, a subnational picture of progress and performance can be obtained for use in regular health sector reviews."

We combine crystal structures of CIDR?1:EPCR complexes with analysis of 885 CIDR?1 sequences, showing that the EPCR-binding surfaces of CIDR?1 domains are conserved in shape and bonding potential, despite dramatic sequence diversity. Additionally, these domains mimic features of the natural EPCR ligand and can block this ligand interaction. Using peptides corresponding to the EPCR-binding region, antibodies can be purified from individuals in malaria-endemic regions that block EPCR binding of diverse CIDR?1 variants. This highlights the extent to which such a surface protein family can diversify while maintaining ligand-binding capacity and identifies features that should be mimicked in immunogens to prevent EPCR binding."

Supporting this view, large-scale studies of national African demographic surveys consistently demonstrate that poor child health outcomes are concentrated in polygynous households. Negative population-level associations between polygyny and well-being have also been reported, consistent with the hypothesis that modern transitions to socially imposed monogamy are driven by cultural group selection. We challenge the consensus view that polygyny is harmful, drawing on multilevel data from 56 ethnically diverse Tanzanian villages. We first demonstrate the vulnerability of aggregated data to confounding between ecological and individual determinants of health; while across villages polygyny is associated with poor child health and low food security, such relationships are absent or reversed within villages, particularly when children and fathers are coresident. We then provide data indicating that the costs of sharing a husband are offset by greater wealth (land and livestock) of polygynous households. These results are consistent with models of polygyny based on female choice. Finally, we show that village-level negative associations between polygyny prevalence, food security, and child health are fully accounted for by underlying differences in ecological vulnerability (rainfall) and socioeconomic marginalization (access to education). We highlight the need for improved, culturally sensitive measurement tools and appropriate scales of analysis in studies of polygyny and other purportedly harmful practices and discuss the relevance of our results to theoretical accounts of marriage and contemporary population policy."

This was a cross-sectional and prospective observational study conducted at Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Patients were ?18 years of age, with HF defined according to the Framingham criteria. The primary outcome was anaemia and the secondary outcome was a composite of hospitalisation for HF or all-cause mortality. A total of 401 HF patients (median age 56 years, IQR 41-67 years; women 51%) were included. The prevalence of anaemia was 57%. The overall prevalence of ID was 49% distributed as 69% versus 21% in subjects with and without anaemia (p<0.001). Normocytic anaemia was seen in 18% of the patients while none had macrocytic anaemia. The risk of having anaemia was positively associated with residency outside Dar es Salaam (OR 1.72 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.89); p=0.038), atrial fibrillation (4.12 (1.60 to 10.61); p=0.003), LVEF <45% (2.70 (1.57 to 4.67); p<0.001) and negatively (ORs per unit decrease) with creatinine clearance (0.98 (0.97 to 0.99); p=0.012) and total cholesterol (0.78 (0.63 to 0.98); p=0.029).

Results: The M. senegalensis extract was found non-toxic and the oral median lethal dose in mice was determined to be greater than 1,600 mg/kg body weight. The findings revealed a significant (P = 0.001) daily increase in the level of parasitaemia in the parasitized untreated groups and a significant (P < 0.001) dose dependent decrease in parasitaemia in the parasitized groups treated with varying doses ranging from 25 to 100 mg/kg body weight of M. senegalensis extract and the standard drug sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine at 25/1.25 mg/kg body weight. Overall, the dose dependent parasitaemia suppression effects were in the order of: 25/1.25 mg/kg body weight of sulphadoxine/ pyrimethamine > 100 mg/kg > 75 mg/kg > 50 mg/kg > 25 mg/kg body weight of M. senegalensis extract. Conclusion: The implications of these findings is that M. senegalensis ethanolic root bark extract possess potent antiplasmodial effect and may, therefore, serve as potential sources of safe, effective and affordable anti-malarial drugs. The displayed high in vivo antiplasmodial activity and lack of toxic effect render M. senegalensis a candidate for the bioassay-guided isolation of compounds which could develop into new lead structures and candidates for drug development programmes against human malaria."

Whether females and/or males are protected by G6PD deficiency is uncertain, due in part to G6PD and malaria phenotypic complexity and misclassification. Almost all large association studies have genotyped a limited number of G6PD SNPs (e.g. G6PD202 / G6PD376), and this approach has been too blunt to capture the complete epidemiological picture. Here we have identified 68 G6PD polymorphisms and analysed 29 of these (i.e. those with a minor allele frequency greater than 1%) in 983 severe malaria cases and controls in Tanzania. We establish, across a number of SNPs including G6PD376, that only female heterozygotes are protected from severe malaria. Haplotype analysis reveals the G6PD locus to be under balancing selection, suggesting a mechanism of protection relying on alleles at modest frequency and avoiding fixation, where protection provided by G6PD deficiency against severe malaria is offset by increased risk of life-threatening complications. Our study also demonstrates that the much-needed large-scale studies of severe malaria and G6PD enzymatic function across African populations require the identification and analysis of the full repertoire of G6PD genetic markers."

Knowledge on causes of occupational exposure varied with the cadre of healthcare workers. Nurses were more likely to have comprehensive knowledge on occupational exposure to HIV than non-clinical staff (OR¿=¿2.6; 95% CI 1.5 ¿ 4.5)ConclusionA substantial proportion of studied healthcare workers had little knowledge on occupational exposure to HIV and was not aware of a contact person in the event of occupational exposure to HIV. Training on post exposure prophylaxis and infection prevention and control including the use of person protective equipment provided to nurses and clinicians should be extended to other clinical and non-clinical hospital staff."

(Diptera: Culicidae) in Muleba, Tanzania has developed high levels of resistance to most insecticides currently advocated for malaria control. The kdr mutation has almost reached fixation in An.?gambiae s.s. in Muleba. This change has the potential to jeopardize malaria control interventions carried out in the region. Trends in insecticide resistance were monitored in two intervention villages using World Health Organization (WHO) susceptibility test kits. Additional mechanisms contributing to observed phenotypic resistance were investigated using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) bottle bioassays with piperonylbutoxide (PBO) and S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) synergists. Resistance genotyping for kdr and Ace-1 alleles was conducted using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In both study villages, high phenotypic resistance to several pyrethroids and DDT was observed, with mortality in the range of 12-23%. There was a sharp decrease in mortality in An.?gambiae s.l. exposed to bendiocarb (carbamate) from 84% in November 2011 to 31% in December 2012 after two rounds of bendiocarb-based indoor residual spraying (IRS). Anopheles gambiae s.l. remained susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl (organophosphate). Bendiocarb-based IRS did not lead to the reversion of pyrethroid resistance. There was no evidence for selection for Ace-1 resistance alleles. The need to investigate the operational impact of the observed resistance selection on the effectiveness of longlasting insecticidal nets and IRS for malaria control is urgent."

Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, heads of households were interviewed on their knowledge and perceptions on malaria transmission, symptoms and prevention and knowledge and practices as regards to climate change and food security.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Results: A total of 399 individuals (mean age?=?39.8?±?15.5 years) were interviewed. Most (62.41%) of them had attained primary school education and majority (91.23%) were involved in crop farming activities. Nearly all (94.7%) knew that malaria is acquired through a mosquito bite. Three quarters (73%) reported that most people get sick from malaria during the rainy season. About 50% of the respondents felt that malaria had decreased during the last 10 years. The household coverage of insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITN) was high (95.5%). Ninety-six percent reported to have slept under a mosquito net the previous night. Only one in four understood the official Kiswahili term (Mabadiliko ya Tabia Nchi) for climate change. However, there was a general understanding that the rain patterns have changed in the past 10 years. Sixty-two percent believed that the temperature has increased during the same period. Three quarters of the respondents reported that they had no sufficient production from their own farms to guarantee food security in their household for the year. Three quarters (73.0%) reported to having food shortages in the past five years. About half said they most often experienced severe food shortage during the rainy season.                                              Conclusion: Farming communities in Kilosa District have little knowledge on climate change and its impact on malaria burden. Food insecurity is common and community-based strategies to mitigate this need to be established.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria, anaemia and nutritional status in relation to livelihoods, ecosystem and health systems in Kilosa District in central Tanzania. Methods This study was conducted in four villages, two characterised by rice irrigation ecosystem and the other two by dry savannah ecosystem and pastoral livelihoods. In each ecosystem, one of the villages had a healthcare facility. Schoolchildren were screened for malaria infection using malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) and microscopy and they were assessed for their anaemia and nutritional statuses. Results A total of 1,019 school children (age = 4–16 years) were screened for malaria infection. The overall prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection was 10.6 % and 4.5 % by mRDT and microscopy, respectively. Children from pastoral villages had lower (2.9 %) prevalence of malaria than their counterparts (18.2 %) in the rice irrigation villages. A significantly high risk of malaria was observed among children in rice irrigation than in the pastoral ecosystem (OR: 0.13; 95%CI 0.07, 0.23). Children living in areas with health care facilities had a low odd of malaria infection by 45 % (OR: 0.55; 95 % CI = 0.35, 0.86). Overall, the prevalence of anaemia in the district was 43.4 % (n = 775); and 58.3 % of those with severe anaemia were among children from the pastoral villages. Anaemia was significantly higher among children not using mosquito nets (p = 0.049); and among those with malaria infection (p <0.001). The majority (96 %) of the children had Body Mass Index less than 18.5 kg/m2 which indicate high proportion of underweight. Conclusion There are significant variations in the risk of acquiring malaria infection between different ecosystems and livelihoods. These findings suggest that malaria control programmes must take into account ecosystems and livelihoods of the targeted population through an integrated management of malaria and nutrition approach."

The study involved five villages namely Tindiga and Malui (wetland/rice irrigation), Twatwatwa and Mbwade (dry savannah) and Kimamba (wet savannah). Indoor mosquitoes were sampled using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps in three houses in each village. Anopheles gambiae s.l. molecular identification was carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 936 female mosquitoes were collected. About half (46.9%) were malaria mosquitoes (Anopheles gambiae s.l.=28.6%; An. funestus= 18.3%). A total of 161 (60.1%) of the morphologically identified An. gambiae s.l. (268) and subjected to PCR analysis for speciation were genotyped as An. arabiensis. The An. funestus complex mosquitoes were composed of An. funestus funestus and An. rivulorum at the 5:1 ratio. On average, 17.9 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected per village per day. Two-thirds (62.8%) of the malaria mosquitoes were collected in Malui (rice agro-ecosystem) and the lowest number (2.3%) in Twatwatwa (dry savannah ecosystem). The biting rate per person per night for An. arabiensis+An. funestus s.s. was highest in Malui (46.0) and lowest in Twatwatwa (1.67). The parity rate of the An. funestus mosquitoes was lower compared to that of An. arabiensis and none of the mosquitoes was infected with malaria sporozoites. In conclusion, An. arabiensis is the most abundant malaria vector in Kilosa district and its variation is related to the ecological system. The heterogeneity in malaria mosquito abundance and human biting rate could be used to guide selection of locally appropriated control interventions."

Methods: A documentary review was performed to assess the structure of the health system with reference to the status and capacity of the NHLS to support HIV diagnosis. Key informant interviews were also held with laboratory staff in all levels of the health care delivery system in four regions with different levels of HIV prevalence. Information sought included availability and utilization of laboratory guidelines, quality and the capacity of laboratories for diagnosis of HIV.                                                                                                                                    Results: The findings indicate that a well-established NHLS was in place. However, the coordination of HIV laboratory services was found to be weak. Forty six respondents were interviewed. In most laboratories, guidelines for HIV diagnosis were available but health care providers were not aware of their availability. Utilization of the guidelines for HIV diagnosis was higher at national level than at the lower levels. The low level of awareness and utilization of guidelines was associated with inadequate training and supervision. There was a shortage of human resource, mostly affecting the primary health care level of the system and this was associated with inequity in employment and training opportunities. Laboratories in public health facilities were better staffed and had more qualified personnel than private-owned laboratories.                                                                                                            Conclusion:Tanzania has a well established national health laboratory network sufficient to support HIV care and treatment services. However, laboratories at the primary health care level are constrained by inadequate resources and operate within a limited capacity. Improving the laboratory capacity in terms of number of qualified personnel, staff training on the national guidelines, laboratory diagnostic tools and coordination should be given a higher priority."

Over the last decade youth friendly reproductive health services have been promoted and implemented world-wide. However, long term evidence of the impact of these programmes is lacking. We report the results of a large mystery client evaluation of adolescent sexual and reproductive health services in Tanzania, a country that has had a long established youth friendly policy. Forty-eight visits made to thirty-three health facilities were conducted by twelve young people (six in each region) trained to perform three different scripted scenarios (i.e., condom request, information on sexually transmitted infections and family planning). The study revealed barriers in relation to poor signage and reception for services. In addition health workers demonstrated paternalistic attitudes as well as lack of knowledge about adolescent sexual and reproductive health services. In some cases, health workers discouraged young people from using services such as condoms and family planning methods. Lack of confidentiality and privacy were also noted to be common challenges for the young people involved. Intervention strategies that focus on changing health workers’ mind-set in relation to adolescent sexual and reproductive health are crucial for ensuring quality provision of sexual and reproductive health services to young people. The study identified the importance of reception or signs at the health units, as this can facilitate young people’s efforts in seeking sexual and reproductive health services. Likewise, improvement of health workers knowledge of existing policy and practice on sexual and reproductive health services and youth friendly services is much needed."

FINDINGS: Between Feb 9, 2012, and Sept 30, 2013, 1001 patients were randomly assigned to clinic plus community support and 998 to standard care. 89 (9%) of 1001 participants in the clinic plus community support group did not receive their assigned intervention, and 11 (1%) of 998 participants in the standard care group received a home visit or a cryptococcal antigen screen rather than only standard care. At 12 months, 25 (2%) of 1001 participants in the clinic plus community support group and 24 (2%) of 998 participants in the standard care group had been lost to follow-up, and were censored at their last visit for the primary analysis. At 12 months, 134 (13%) of 1001 participants in the clinic plus community support group had died compared with 180 (18%) of 998 in the standard care group. Mortality was 28% (95% CI 10-43) lower in the clinic plus community support group than in standard care group (p=0·004).

Hence, little is known about the diversity of Mycobacterium spp. in TB infections. Different genotypes or lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis vary in virulence and induce different inflammatory and immune responses. Trained Cricetomys rats show a potential for rapid diagnosis of TB. They detect over 28 % of smear-negative, culture-positive TB. However, it is unknown whether these rats can equally detect sputa from patients infected with different genotypes of M. tuberculosis. A 4-month prospective study on diversity of Mycobacterium spp. was conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 252 sputa from 161 subjects were cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen medium and thereafter tested by rats. Mycobacterial isolates were subjected to molecular identification and multispacer sequence typing (MST) to determine species and genotypes. A total of 34 Mycobacterium spp. isolates consisting of 32 M. tuberculosis, 1 M. avium subsp. hominissuis and 1 M. intracellulare were obtained. MST analyses of 26 M. tuberculosis isolates yielded 10 distinct MST genotypes, including 3 new genotypes with two clusters of related patterns not grouped by geographic areas. Genotype MST-67, shared by one-third of M. tuberculosis isolates, was associated with the Mwananyamala clinic. This study shows that diverse M. tuberculosis genotypes (n = 10) occur in Dar es Salaam and trained rats detect 80 % of the genotypes. Sputa with two M. tuberculosis genotypes (20 %), M. avium hominissuis and M. intracellulare were not detected. Therefore, rats detect sputa with different M. tuberculosis genotypes and can be used to detect TB in resource-poor countries."

All the individuals involved in the development of the plans were either medical or health professionals. According to key informants, sectoral activities identified to contribute to malaria transmission included farming systems, deforestation, fishing, nomadic pastoralism, household water storage, water resource development projects, road and house construction and mining. The lack of intersectoral approaches in malaria control programme included the facts that the Health Sector does not involve other sectors during planning and development of policy guidelines, differences in sectoral mandates and management culture, lack of a national coordinating framework and lack of budget for intersectoral activities.

METHODS: The study was conducted between March 2004 and December 2013 within the sickle cell disease (SCD) programme at Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania. SCD status was categorized into HbAA, HbAS and HbSS using hemoglobin electrophoresis and High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). HbF levels were determined by HPLC. Malaria was diagnosed using rapid diagnostic test and/or blood film. Logistic regression and generalized estimating equations models were used to evaluate associations between SCD status, HbF and malaria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  FINDINGS: 2,049 individuals with age range 0-70 years, HbAA 311(15.2%), HbAS 241(11.8%) and HbSS 1,497(73.1%) were analysed. At enrolment, malaria prevalence was significantly higher in HbAA 13.2% compared to HbAS 1.24% and HbSS 1.34% (p<0.001). Mean HbF was lower in those with malaria compared to those without malaria in HbAA (0.43% vs 0.82%) but was the reverse in HbSS (8.10% vs 5.59%). An increase in HbF was associated with a decrease in risk of malaria OR=0.50 (95%CI: 0.28, 0.90; p=0.021) in HbAA, whereas for HbSS the risk of malaria increased OR=2.94 (1.44, 5.98; p=0.003). A similar pattern was seen during multiple visits; HbAA OR=0.52 (0.34, 0.80; p=0.003) vs HbSS OR=2.01 (1.27, 3.23; p=0.003).                   NCLUSION:Higher prevalence of malaria in HbAA compared to HbAS and HbSS confirmed the protective effect of HbS. Lower prevalence of malaria in HbAA with high HbF supports a protective effect of HbF. However, in HbSS, the higher prevalence of malaria with high levels of HbF suggests loss of malaria protection. This is the first epidemiological study to suggest a negative epistasis between HbF and HbS on malaria."

This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of chlorination across a range of turbidities found in rural water sources, following local dosing guidelines that recommend a 'double dose' for water that is visibly turbid. We chlorinated water from 43 sources representing a range of turbidities using two locally available chlorine-based disinfectants: WaterGuard and Aquatabs. We determined free available chlorine at 30 min and 24 h contact time. Our data suggest that water chlorination with WaterGuard or Aquatabs can be effective using both single and double doses up to 20 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), or using a double dose of Aquatabs up to 100 NTU, but neither was effective at turbidities greater than 100 NTU"

HbF levels are strongly influenced by genetic variants at three major genetic loci, Xmn1-HBG2, HMIP-2, and BCL11A, but the effect of these loci on the hematological phenotype in SCD, has so far not been investigated. In a cohort of individuals with SCD in Tanzania (HbSS and HbS/?° thalassemia, n = 726, aged 5 or older), HbF levels were positively correlated with hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) indices, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and negatively with white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts (all P < 0.0001). We subsequently assessed the contribution of the three HbF modifier loci and detected diverse effects, including a reduction in anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis associated with certain HbF-promoting alleles. The presence of the 'T' allele at Xmn1-HBG2 led to a significant increase in hemoglobin (P = 9.8 × 10(-3) ) but no changes in cellular hemoglobin content. Xmn1-HBG2 'T' also has a weak effect decreasing WBC (P = 0.06) and platelet (P = 0.06) counts. The BCL11A variant (rs11886868-'C') increases hemoglobin (P = 2 × 10(-3) ) and one of the HBS1L-MYB variants decreases WBC values selectively (P = 2.3 × 10(-4) ). The distinct pattern of effects of each variant suggests that both, disease alleviation through increased HbF production, and 'pleiotropic' effects on blood cells, are involved, affecting a variety of pathways."

While they have no consequences in healthy individuals, high HbF levels have major clinical benefits in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or ? thalassemia. Here, we present our detailed investigation of HBS1L-MYB intergenic polymorphism block 2 (HMIP-2), the central component of the complex quantitative-trait locus upstream of MYB, in 1,022 individuals with SCD in Tanzania. Methods: We have looked at 1022 individuals with HbSS or HbS/?0 in Tanzania. In order to achieve a detailed analysis of HMIP-2, we performed targeted genotyping for a total of 10 SNPs and extracted additional 528 SNPs information from a genome wide scan involving the same population. Using MACH, we utilized the existing YRI data from 1000 genomes to impute 54 SNPs situated within HIMP-2. Results: Seven HbF-increasing, low-frequency variants (? > 0.3, p < 10?5, f ? 0.05) were located in two partially-independent sub-loci, HMIP-2A and HMIP-2B. The spectrum of haplotypes carrying such alleles was diverse when compared to European and West African reference populations: we detected one such haplotype at sub-locus HMIP-2A, two at HMIP-2B, and a fourth including high-HbF alleles at both sub-loci (‘Eurasian’ haplotype clade). In the region of HMIP-2A a putative functional variant (a 3-bp indel) has been described previously, but no such candidate causative variant exists at HMIP-2B. Extending our dataset through imputation with 1000 Genomes, whole-genome-sequence data, we have mapped peak association at HMIP-2B to an 11-kb region around rs9494145 and rs9483788, flanked by two conserved regulatory elements for MYB. Conclusions: Studies in populations from the African continent provide distinct opportunities for mapping disease-modifying genetic loci, especially for conditions that are highly prevalent there, such as SCD. Population-genetic characteristics of our cohort, such as ethnic diversity and the predominance of shorter, African-type haplotypes, can add to the power of such studies."

A study was done to assess the influence of real and perceived costs of ANC seeking on pregnant women’s access to Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Pregnancy (IPTp) against malaria in two rural districts in Tanzania. Exist interviews were administered to 823 pregnant women leaving ANC clinics, among which 417 and 406 came from Mkuranga and Mufindi districts, respectively. Data analysis was executed using STATA 8 statistical software. Of all interviewees, 66.2% and 89.3% of respondents in Mkuranga and Mufindi, respectively, previously contacted government clinics during their current pregnancies; less than 20% and 15% of these districts, respectively, had contacted private clinics. Respondents reporting to have paid user-fees on the study day accounted for 36.7% and 7.0% in both districts, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to determine the association between knowledge and utilization of IPTp by pregnant women attending ANC services at Dangamvura and Sakubva Mutare city clinics. Pender’s health promotion model was used to guide and direct the study. A descriptive correlation design was used for the study. The author examined the strength of the relationship between knowledge and utilisation of IPTp by pregnant women attending ANC at Dangamvura and Sakubva Mutare Clinics. A sample of 80 women who were attending ANC visits was selected by systematic random sampling. Data were collected through face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Interview guide consisted of questions on knowledge and utilization of IPTp and the association between knowledge and utilization were asked. Additionally Focus Group Discussions were used. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Pearson’s correlation showed an insignificant correlation (r=0.097) women’s knowledge to utilisation of IPTp. The findings did not support that knowledge on IPTp improves utilisation of the program. It is important therefore for Midwives to intensify tailor made health education and motivate women to utilise IPTp services."

However, evidence on factors leading to their inadequate use in developing countries is still scanty. This paper reports an exploratory study of factors constraining condoms use in Tanzania from the perspectives of barmaids, guest-house workers and retailers. Data were collected in two districts—Mpwapwa in Dodoma Region and Mbeya Rural in Mbeya Region—between October and December 2011, using structured interviews with 238 individuals including barmaids, guesthouse workers and 145 retailers. Data analysis was performed using STATA 11 software. Awareness about condoms was high among all study groups. Male condoms were more popular and available than female ones. A considerable proportion of the barmaids and guesthouses were disappointed with condoms being promoted and distributed to young children and disliked condom use during sexual intercourse. Accessibility of condoms was reported as being lowered by condom prices, shortage of information concerning their availability; short supply of condoms; some people shying away to be watched by children or adult people while purchasing condoms; retailers’ using bad languages to condom customers; occasionally condom shops/kiosks found closed when they are urgently needed; and prevailing social perception of condoms to have low/no protective efficacy. Regression analysis of data from barmaids and guesthouse-workers indicated variations in the degree of condom acceptability and methods used to promote condoms among respondents with different demographic characteristics. A combination of psychosocial and economic factors was found contributing to lower the demand for and actual use of condoms in study communities. Concerted measures for promoting condom use need to address the demand challenges and making operational research an integral element of monitoring and evaluation of the launched interventions, hence widening the evidence for informed policy decisions.

We aimed to determine whether respiratory rate was likely to be transiently raised by a number of contextual factors in a busy clinic leading to inaccurate diagnosis.                                      METHODS: Respiratory rates were recorded in children aged 2-59 months presenting with cough or difficulty breathing to one of the two busy outpatient clinics and then repeated at 10-min intervals over 1 h in a quiet setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-seven children were enrolled with a mean age of 7.1 (SD ± 2.9) months in infants and 27.6 (SD ± 12.8) months in children aged 12-59 months. The mean respiratory rate declined from 42.3 and 33.6 breaths per minute (bpm) in the clinic to 39.1 and 32.6 bpm after 10 min in a quiet room and to 39.2 and 30.7 bpm (P < 0.001) after 60 min in younger and older children, respectively. This resulted in 11/13 (85%) infants and 2/15 (13%) older children being misclassified with non-severe pneumonia. In a random effects linear regression model, the variability in respiratory rate within children (42%) was almost as much as the variability between children (58%). Changing the respiratory rates cut-offs to higher thresholds resulted in a small reduction in the proportion of non-severe pneumonia mis-classifications in infants.                                                                                                               CONCLUSION: Noise and other contextual factors may cause a transient increase in respiratory rate and consequently misclassification of non-severe pneumonia. However, this effect is less pronounced in older children than infants. Respiratory rate is a difficult sign to measure as the variation is large between and within children. More studies of the accuracy and utility of respiratory rate as a proxy for non-severe pneumonia diagnosis in a busy clinic are needed."

Tuberculous lymphadenitis is the most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) with a female and paediatric preponderance, postulated to be due to differences in the immune response. The aim of this study was to analyze the differences in the serum cytokine levels of tuberculous lymphadenitis patients with respect to age and gender. Methods. A multiplex bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure IFN-í µí»¾, TNF-í µí»¼, GM-CSF, IL-1í µí»½, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-17 levels in sera of patients (í µí±› = 86) and healthy controls (í µí±› = 23). Results. Levels of IFN-í µí»¾, TNF-í µí»¼, GM-CSF, IL-1í µí»½, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 were higher in adult patients than in controls, while those of IL-12 were lower (í µí±ƒ < 0.05). Children had lower levels of TNF-í µí»¼, GM-CSF, and IL-5 and higher levels of IL-2 compared with adult patients (í µí±ƒ < 0.05). The male adult patients had higher levels of IL-17 and lower levels of IL-12 compared with female adult patients (í µí±ƒ < 0.05). Conclusion. There were significant differences in the levels of circulating cytokines with respect to gender and age. Children had generally lower levels of cytokines as compared to adults, which could make them more susceptible. Findings do not support that female preponderance is due to differences in immune response."

Schistosomiasis and intestinal worm-related perceptions and practices were assessed before and 3 years after implementation of a participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) intervention as a control measure. Data were obtained from baseline and post-intervention knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) questionnaire surveys conducted twice in 2009 and 2012 among 82 individuals aged ?15 years. We found significant increases in respondents’ knowledge of the cause, transmission, symptoms, health consequences, and prevention of schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections after PHAST intervention. The increase in respondents’ knowledge on almost all aspects of the said infections was translated into actions to control schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections. This has not been achieved by chance, but due to well-designed and locally-adapted PHAST intervention. We conclude that despite criticisms, PHAST approach is still useful in empowering communities to control water, sanitation, and hygiene related infectious diseases such as schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections."

The use of household asset data to determine wealth indices is a common procedure for estimating socio-economic position in resource poor settings. In such settings information about income is usually lacking, and the collection of individual consumption or expenditure data would require in-depth interviews, posing a considerable risk of bias. In this study, we determined the socio-economic status of 213 households in a community population in an island in the north-western Tanzania before and 3 year after implementation of a participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) intervention to control schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections. We constructed a household 'wealth index' based housing construction features (e.g., type of roof, walls, and floor) and durable assets ownership (e.g., bicycle, radio, etc.). We employed principal components analysis and classified households into wealth quintiles. The study revealed that asset variables with positive factor scores were associated with higher socio-economic status, whereas asset variables with negative factor scores were associated with lower socio-economic status. Overall, households which were rated as the poorest and very poor were on the decrease, whereas those rated as poor, less poor, and the least poor were on the increase after PHAST intervention. This decrease/increase was significant. The median shifted from -0.4376677 to 0.5001073, and the mean from -0.2605787 (SD; 2.005688) to 0.2605787 (SD; 1.831199). The difference in socio-economic status of the people between the 2 phases was highly statistically significant (P<0.001). We argue that finding of this study should be treated with caution as there were other interventions to control schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections which were running concurrently on Kome Island apart from PHAST intervention."

The ethnic groups are the Luguru in the Mvomero District and the Bena in the Njombe District. In both societies, milk-based interventions involving the introduction of dairy goats and cattle have been implemented. The underlying assumption guiding these interventions is that with increased milk production there would be increased milk consumption at the household level, leading to an improvement in children's health and nutritional status. Our study questions these assumptions. Methods used for data collection included semi-structured interviews, participant observation, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. In our analysis, recognising the multiple realities and diverse social practices of different actors has been central to understanding household responses to milk-based interventions and their effects. We find that women – as mothers – in both societies have the major responsibility to provide food for children. In both societies, social norms and household needs also oblige mothers to allocate part of their time to performing productive activities that generate income for their households. Despite their contribution to income generation, women's decision-making power regarding the spending of household income is limited. Men usually control the sale of marketable agricultural products, including the milk produced, and the income is used to cover the expenses for which men are responsible. As a result, neither the milk itself nor the incomes generated by the sale of milk are used in ways that significantly improve the nutritional status of under-fives in dairy-keeping households."

Objective: To determine the abundance and distribution of mosquito vectors in relation to their potential role in the virus transmission and maintenance in disease epidemic areas of Ngorongoro district in northern Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional entomological investigation was carried out before the suspected RVF outbreak in October 2012. Mosquitoes were sampled both outdoors and indoors using the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) light traps and Mosquito Magnets baited with attractants. Outdoor traps were placed in proximity with breeding sites and under canopy in banana plantations close to the sleeping places of animals. Results: A total of 1,823 mosquitoes were collected, of which 87% (N=1,588) were Culex pipiens complex, 12% (N=226) Aedes aegypti, and 0.5% (N=9) Anopheles species. About two-thirds (67%; N=1,095) of C. pipiens complex and nearly 100% (N=225) of A. aegypti were trapped outdoors using Mosquito Magnets. All Anopheles species were trapped indoors using CDC light traps. There were variations in abundance of C. pipiens complex and A. aegypti among different ecological and vegetation habitats. Over three quarters (78%) of C. pipiens complex and most (85%) of the A. aegypti were trapped in banana and maize farms. Both C. pipiens complex and A. aegypti were more abundant in proximity with cattle and in semi-arid thorn bushes and lower Afro-montane. The highest number of mosquitoes was recorded in villages that were most affected during the RVF epidemic of 2007. Of the tested 150 pools of C. pipiens complex and 45 pools of A. aegypti, none was infected with RVF virus.

We investigated whether the vaccine efficacy was specific to certain parasite genotypes at the circumsporozoite protein locus.                                                   METHODS:We used polymerase chain reaction-based next-generation sequencing of DNA extracted from samples from 4985 participants to survey circumsporozoite protein polymorphisms. We evaluated the effect that polymorphic positions and haplotypic regions within the circumsporozoite protein had on vaccine efficacy against first episodes of clinical malaria within 1 year after vaccination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            RESULTS:In the per-protocol group of 4577 RTS,S/AS01-vaccinated participants and 2335 control-vaccinated participants who were 5 to 17 months of age, the 1-year cumulative vaccine efficacy was 50.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.6 to 62.3) against clinical malaria in which parasites matched the vaccine in the entire circumsporozoite protein C-terminal (139 infections), as compared with 33.4% (95% CI, 29.3 to 37.2) against mismatched malaria (1951 infections) (P=0.04 for differential vaccine efficacy). The vaccine efficacy based on the hazard ratio was 62.7% (95% CI, 51.6 to 71.3) against matched infections versus 54.2% (95% CI, 49.9 to 58.1) against mismatched infections (P=0.06). In the group of infants 6 to 12 weeks of age, there was no evidence of differential allele-specific vaccine efficacy.                                                                                                                                                                                 CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that among children 5 to 17 months of age, the RTS,S vaccine has greater activity against malaria parasites with the matched circumsporozoite protein allele than against mismatched malaria. The overall vaccine efficacy in this age category will depend on the proportion of matched alleles in the local parasite population; in this trial, less than 10% of parasites had matched alleles.

Methods: Data were collected through a quantitative population survey, a quantitative health facility survey and focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) in subgroups of population survey participants. The main focus of this paper is the findings from the FGDs and IDIs.                                                                                                                        Results: We conducted 24 FGDs, involving approximately 180 adult participants and IDIs with 116 participants (?18 years). CDs studied included: asthma/chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), diabetes, epilepsy, hypertension, cardiac failure and HIV- related disease. The understanding of most chronic conditions involved a combination of biomedical information, gleaned from health facility visits, local people who had suffered from a complaint or knew others who had and beliefs drawn from information shared in the community. The biomedical contribution shows some understanding of the aetiology of a condition and the management of that condition. However, local beliefs for certain conditions (such as epilepsy) suggest that biomedical treatment may be futile and therefore work counter to biomedical prescriptions for management.                                                                                   Conclusion: Current perceptions of selected CDs may represent a barrier that prevents people from adopting efficacious health and treatment seeking behaviours. Interventions to improve this situation must include efforts to improve the quality of existing health services, so that people can access relevant, reliable and trustworthy services."

To prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes caused by syphilis, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends syphilis screening and treatment of all pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) services. Rapid syphilis testing (RST) demonstration project was introduced at ANC clinics in Tanzania in 2009, to assess the feasibility, acceptability and its impact on uptake of syphilis screening service. Data collection was composed of in-depth interviews with health workers and pregnant women attending ANC. Additionally, from the health facility registers we extracted information on the uptake of antenatal care services, including number of pregnant women screened and treated for syphilis. Introduction of RST at health facilities was appreciated by pregnant women attending ANC and health workers. Following the introduction of RST services at ANC clinics, we observed a significant increase of the uptake of syphilis screening. Pregnant women appreciated RST service since it reduced the frequency of their visits to the health facilities and shortened the duration that they spent at the clinics. Moreover, the provision of same-day screening and treatment services helped women to save money that they would have to spend on transportation for the follow up visits. Health workers felt that RST simplified procedures to diagnose syphilis, and enabled the health workers to test and treat large numbers of clients in a shorter period of time. Our study demonstrates that, it is feasible to introduce RST service in antenatal clinics. The RST was appreciated by health workers and pregnant women, since it simplifies syphilis screening procedures, saves the time that pregnant women used to waste to wait for the results, and saves the cost that women would have to spend on transportation to come back for treatment."

Pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa and new insecticides with different modes of action are urgently needed if malaria vector control is to remain effective. Indoxacarb is an oxadiazine insecticide that is effective as an oral and contact insecticide against a broad spectrum of agricultural pests and, due to its unique site of action, no cross-resistance has been detected through mechanisms associated with resistance to insecticides currently used in public health. Methods WHO tunnel tests of host seeking mosquitoes were carried out as a forerunner to experimental hut trials, to provide information on dosage-dependent mortality, repellency, and blood-feeding inhibition. A dosage range of indoxacarb treated netting (100–1000 mg/m2) was tested against a pyrethroid susceptible strain of Anopheles gambiae. In addition, efficacy of indoxacarb 500 mg/m2 was compared with a standard pyrethroid formulation against pyrethroid susceptible and resistant Culex quinquefasciatus. Dosages between 25 and 300 mg/m2 indoxacarb were tested in tunnel tests and in ball-frame bioassays as mixtures with alphacypermethrin 25 mg/m2 and were compared with singly applied treatments against an insectary reared pyrethroid resistant strain of Cx. quinquefasciatus originally collected in Cotonou, Benin. Results There was a dosage-dependent response in terms of indoxacarb induced mortality, with dosages >100 mg/m2 producing the best mortality response. In tunnel tests indoxacarb 500 mg/m2 exceeded WHOPES thresholds with >80 % mortality of adult An. gambiae and blood-feeding inhibition of 75 %. No cross-resistance to indoxacarb was detected through mechanisms associated with resistance to pyrethroid insecticides and was equally effective against susceptible and resistant strains of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Indoxacarb 500 mg/m2 killed 75 % of pyrethroid resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus compared with only 21 % mortality with alphacypermethrin 40 mg/m2. Mixtures of indoxacarb with pyrethroid produced an additive response for both mortality and blood-feeding inhibition. The best performing mixture (indoxacarb 200 mg/m2 + alphacypermethrin 25 mg/m2) killed 83 % of pyrethroid resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus and reduced blood-feeding by 88 %, while alphacypermethrin only killed 36 % and inhibited blood-feeding by 50 %. Conclusions New insecticides with different modes of action to those currently used in mosquito vector control are urgently needed. Indoxacarb shows great promise as a mixture with a pyrethroid and should be evaluated in experimental hut trials to determine performance against wild free-flying, pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae and wash-resistant formulations developed."

Therefore, we aimed to determine the distribution of low estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) in urban and rural Tanzania; to describe factors associated with low eGFR, and to quantify fractions attributable to common risk factors. Methods: We conducted a community based survey of 1095 randomly selected Tanzanian adults (?18 years). A structured questionnaire and examinations were used to document socio-demographic characteristics, diet, physical activity, anthropomorphic measurements and blood pressure. Blood tests were performed for HIV infection, diabetes mellitus and creatinine. eGFR was calculated using 2 equations recommended for African adults. Results: Serum creatinine was available for 1043 participants: 170 in Mwanza city, 326 in district towns and 547 in rural areas. Mean age was 35.5 years and 54% were females. The prevalence of eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m(2) in these 3 strata was 2.3% (95%CI=0.8-6.6%), 7.5% (4.7-11.8%), and 7.4% (5.1-10.6%) respectively. When age-standardised to the WHO world population, prevalences were 3.8%, 10.1% and 8.1%. Factors associated with low eGFR included district town residence, older age, greater wealth, less physical activity and hypertension. Only 21% of cases with eGFR<60mL/min/1.73m(2) were attributable to HIV, hypertension or diabetes. Conclusions: Decreased renal function is common in Tanzania, particularly in district towns, and unique risk factors for kidney disease may exist in this population. Population specific strategies for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of kidney disease are needed for Africa. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved"

This prospective rural/semi-rural Tanzanian cohort of women (n = 102 at delivery; 38% HIV-positive) and their infants (n = 102) investigated breastmilk, maternal and infant serum immunoglobulins (IgA/IgG1-4/IgM) and cytokines (IL-1?/IL-2/IL-6/IL-10/IL-12p70/IL-13/IL-15/TNF-?/IFN-?) at 1, 2, 3, 6-months postpartum. Milk immunoglobulins followed an inverse U-shaped pattern, while cytokine patterns were mixed. Exclusive breastfeeding duration and feeding intensity were associated with greater breastmilk total immunoglobulin and IgA, IgG1-3 and IL-12p70 concentrations. Maternal mastitis, fever or cough was associated with higher breastmilk total cytokine concentrations, while infant fever was associated with lower milk immunoglobulins or cytokines. Strong (r ? 0.40) to weak (r = 0.20-0.29) positive correlations between maternal serum-breastmilk or breastmilk-infant serum immunoglobulins were evident. Breastmilk cytokines were moderate to weakly negatively correlated with infant serum. Breastmilk immunology did not differ by maternal malnutrition or HIV-seropositivity. Mature breastmilk is a dynamic source of many specific and non-specific immune factors associated with maternal and infant health and infant nutrition. Breastfeeding practices are associated with differential breastmilk immunological composition providing immunological support for universal recommendations to exclusively breastfeed for 6-months.

These outcomes were assessed using either a single follow-up Hb on day 7 after an IPTi dose or Hb obtained 1 to 14 or 28 days after each IPTi dose.                                                                       Findings: Relative to placebo, CD reduced Hb by approximately 0.5 g/dL at day 7 and within 14 days of an IPTi dose, and by 0.2 g/dL within 28 days. Adjusted declines in the CD group were larger than in the MQ and SP groups. At day 7, homo-/hemizygous genotype was associated with higher odds of Hb <8 g/dL (adjusted odds ratio = 6.7, 95% CI 1.7 to 27.0) and greater absolute reductions in Hb (-0.6 g/dL, 95% CI -1.1 to 0.003). There was no evidence to suggest increased reductions in Hb among homo-/hemizygous children treated with CD compared to placebo, SP or MQ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Conclusions: While treatment with CD demonstrated greater reductions in Hb at 7 and 14 days after an IPTi dose compared to both SP and MQ, there was no evidence that G6PD deficiency exacerbated the adverse effects of CD, despite evidence for higher hemolysis risk among G6PDd infants."

We aimed to assess predictors of fat and fat-free mass during 2 months of intensive TB treatment in a cohort in Mwanza, Tanzania.Subjects/Methods:Fat and fat-free mass were determined at the start of TB treatment and repeated after 2 months using the deuterium dilution technique. Gains in fat and fat-free mass were determined and predictors assessed using regression analysis.Results:Data for 116 patients were available at baseline and during follow-up. Of these, 38.8% were females, mean age was 37.3 (s.d. 13.5) years, 69% (81) had sputum-positive TB, 45.7% (53) were HIV infected and 25% (29) were current smokers. The mean weight gain was 3.3?kg (95% confidence interval: 2.7; 3.8), and it did not differ by sex. However, compared with females, males had 1.0 (0.4; 1.6) kg/m2 lower fat mass but 0.7 (0.2; 1.3)?kg/m2 higher fat-free mass gain. Current smoking was associated with higher fat mass (0.7?kg/m2, 0.04; 1.4) but lower fat-free mass (?0.5?kg/m2, ?1.2; 0.07) gain. Among HIV-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy (ART) led to a lower fat gain (?1.2?kg/m2, ?2.2; ?0.2) but to a higher fat-free mass among sputum-negative (2.9?kg/m2, 0.8; 5.1) but not sputum-positive patients.Conclusions:During intensive phase of TB treatment, sex, smoking and ART were predictors of body composition. Larger studies are needed to further understand predictors of body composition during recovery, to help design interventions to improve treatment outcomes"

The impact on malaria transmission was evaluated in a cluster randomised trial comparing two rounds of IRS with bendiocarb plus universal coverage ITNs, with ITNs alone in northern Tanzania. From April 2011 to December 2012, eight houses in 20 clusters per study arm were sampled monthly for one night with CDC light trap collections. Anopheles gambiae s.l. were identified to species using real time PCR Taq Man and tested for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein. ITN and IRS coverage was estimated from household surveys. IRS coverage was more than 85% in two rounds of spraying in January and April 2012. Household coverage with at least one ITN per house was 94.7% after the universal coverage net campaign in the baseline year and the proportion of household with all sleeping places covered by LLIN was 50.1% decreasing to 39.1% by the end of the intervention year. An.gambiae s.s. comprised 80% and An.arabiensis18.3% of the anopheline collection in the baseline year. Mean An.gambiae s.l. density in the ITN+IRS arm was reduced by 84% (95%CI: 56%-94%, p = 0.001) relative to the ITN arm. In the stratum of clusters categorised as high anopheline density at baseline EIR was lower in the ITN+IRS arm compared to the ITN arm (0.5 versus 5.4 per house per month, Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.10, 95%CI: 0.01–0.66, p-value for interaction <0.001).

Therefore, it is important to understand the causes of delay and to estimate their magnitude in order to plan interventions that yield the maximum benefit. Methods: A total of 240 subjects aged ?15 year with pulmonary TB were interviewed. Patient delay was defined as the period (in days) from the appearance of any symptoms to the first visit to a medical provider. Results: The median patient delay was 38 days. When using the median as a cut-off to define long patient delay, being an ex-smoker (P?=?0.036), current smoker (P?=?0.030), coughing (P?=?0.021) and losing weight (P?=?0.050) were found to be significant.

The most common reasons for delay were supposed influenza or symptoms improving over time (34.5%) and underestimated symptoms (32.9%). Conclusion: People with smoking habits and health-seeking behaviour that may favour advanced disease and prolonged infectiousness as well as people with the lowest level of education contributed to TB delay. To reduced patient delay, efforts should be made to increase TB knowledge, which has to be adjusted to the less-educated segments of the population."

Consecutive children aged 2-59 months with acute illness were managed using ALMANACH (2 intervention facilities), or standard practice (2 control facilities) in Tanzania. Primary outcomes were proportion of children cured at day 7 and who received antibiotics on day 0. 130/842 (15?4%) in ALMANACH and 241/623 (38?7%) in control arm were diagnosed with an infection in need for antibiotic, while 3?8% and 9?6% had malaria. 815/838 (97?3%;96?1-98.4%) were cured at D7 using ALMANACH versus 573/623 (92?0%;89?8-94?1%) using standard practice (p<0?001). Of 23 children not cured at D7 using ALMANACH, 44% had skin problems, 30% pneumonia, 26% upper respiratory infection and 13% likely viral infection at D0. Secondary hospitalization occurred for one child using ALMANACH and one who eventually died using standard practice. At D0, antibiotics were prescribed to 15?4% (12?9-17?9%) using ALMANACH versus 84?3% (81?4-87?1%) using standard practice (p<0?001). 2?3% (1?3-3.3) versus 3?2% (1?8-4?6%) received an antibiotic secondarily. Management of children using ALMANACH improve clinical outcome and reduce antibiotic prescription by 80%. This was achieved through more accurate diagnoses and hence better identification of children in need of antibiotic treatment or not.

A qualitative approach was applied using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with altogether 40 primary health care workers from 6 public primary health facilities in the three municipalities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Health worker’s perceptions related to factors facilitating or constraining the uptake of the electronic ALMANACH were identified. In general, the ALMANACH was assessed positively. The majority of the respondents felt comfortable to use the devices and stated that patient’s trust was not affected. Most health workers said that the ALMANACH simplified their work, reduced antibiotic prescription and gave correct classification and treatment for common causes of childhood illnesses. Few HWs reported technical challenges using the devices and complained about having had difficulties in typing. Majority of the respondents stated that the devices increased the consultation duration compared to routine practice. In addition, health system barriers such as lack of staff, lack of medicine and lack of financial motivation were identified as key reasons for the low uptake of the devices.

Doi:10.11.1186/s12936-015-0649-8.",Monitoring of efficacy and safety of artemisini-based antimalarials for treatment of uncomplicated malaria: a review of evidence of implementation of antimalarial therapeutic efficacy trials in Tanzania,Malaria,Malaria Journal,2015,14,,135,,3,10.11.1186/s12936-015-0649-8,,,,,,,,"Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment are considered the cornerstones of malaria control and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is currently the main anti-malarial drugs used for case management. After deployment of ACT due to widespread parasite resistance to the cheap and widely used anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine and sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine, the World Health Organization recommends regular surveillance to monitor the efficacy of the new drugs. The present paper assessed the implementation of anti-malarial efficacy testing for monitoring the therapeutic efficacy of ACT for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania before and after policy changes in 2006. A literature search was performed for published clinical trials conducted in Tanzania from 2001 to 2014. It focused on studies which assessed at least one form of ACT for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children less than 10 years and reported efficacy and safety of the tested anti-malarials. References were imported into the Endnote library and duplicates removed. An electronic matrix was developed in Microsoft Excel followed by full text review with predetermined criteria. Studies were independently assessed and information related to ACT efficacy and safety extracted. Nine papers were selected from 125 papers screened. The efficacy of both artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS + AQ) against uncomplicated P. falciparum infections in Tanzania was high with PCR-corrected cure rates on day 28 of 91-100% and 88-93.8%, respectively. The highest day-3 parasite positivity rate was 1.4%. Adverse events ranged from mild to serious but were not directly attributed to the drugs. ACT is efficacious and safe for treatment of uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania. However, few trials were conducted in Tanzania before and after policy changes in 2006 and thus more surveillance should be urgently undertaken to detect future changes in parasite sensitivity to ACT."

The study involved four villages; two with rice farming communities while the other two with pastoral communities. In each village, heads of households or their spouses were interviewed to seek information on livelihoods activities, knowledge and practices on malaria and its preventions. A total of 471 individuals (males=38.9%; females=61.1%) were interviewed. Only 23.5% of the respondents had adequate knowledge on malaria. Fifty-six percent of the respondents could not associate any livelihood activity with malaria transmission. Majority (79%) of the respondents believed that most of fevers were due to malaria; this was higher among the pastoral (81.7%) than rice farming communities (76.1%) (p=0.038). Cases of fever were significantly higher in households with non-educated (31.2%) than educated respondents (21.5%). Women experienced significantly more episodes of fever than men (p<0.001). Of the total of 2606 individuals living in the households, 26.9% were reported to have had fever in the previous three months. Fever was reported more frequently among pastoral than rice farming communities (p<0.01). Of those who had fever, 36.6% were clinically diagnosed with malaria and 22.9% were confirmed to be infected with malaria. A combination of fever+convulsions or joint pains+headache was most frequently perceived to be malaria. Treatment seeking frequency differed by the size of the household and between rice farming and pastoral communities (p=0.05). In conclusion, education, sex, availability of health care facility and livelihood practices were the major social determinants that influence malaria acquisition and care seeking pattern in central Tanzania. Appropriate public health promotion should be designed to address the links of livelihoods and malaria transmission among rural farming communities in an ecohealth approach. Copyright © 2015.

These studies are usually country-specific, use small sample sizes and are not directly comparable due to differences in methodologies. This study brings together samples and data collected from multiple sites across Africa and Asia to use standardized methods to look for consistent genetic effects on anti-malarial antibody levels. Methods: Sera, DNA samples and clinical data were collected from 13,299 individuals from ten sites in Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, and Sri Lanka using standardized methods. DNA was extracted and typed for 202 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms with known associations to malaria or antibody production, and antibody levels to four clinical grade malarial antigens [AMA1, MSP1, MSP2, and (NANP)4] plus total IgE were measured by ELISA techniques. Regression models were used to investigate the associations of clinical and genetic factors with antibody levels. Results: Malaria infection increased levels of antibodies to malaria antigens and, as expected, stable predictors of anti-malarial antibody levels included age, seasonality, location, and ethnicity. Correlations between antibodies to blood-stage antigens AMA1, MSP1 and MSP2 were higher between themselves than with antibodies to the (NANP)4 epitope of the pre-erythrocytic circumsporozoite protein, while there was little or no correlation with total IgE levels. Individuals with sickle cell trait had significantly lower antibody levels to all blood-stage antigens, and recessive homozygotes for CD36 (rs321198) had significantly lower anti-malarial antibody levels to MSP2. Conclusion: Although the most significant finding with a consistent effect across sites was for sickle cell trait, its effect is likely to be via reducing a microscopically positive parasitaemia rather than directly on antibody levels. However, this study does demonstrate a framework for the feasibility of combining data"

Since RVF-like disease was reported in Tanzania in 1930, outbreaks of the disease have been reported mainly from the eastern ecosystem of the Great Rift Valley. This cross-sectional study was carried out to describe the variation in RVF virus (RVFV) seropositivity in domestic ruminants between selected villages in the eastern and western Rift Valley ecosystems in Tanzania, and identify potential risk factors. Three study villages were purposively selected from each of the two Rift Valley ecosystems. Serum samples from randomly selected domestic ruminants (n = 1,435) were tested for the presence of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM), using RVF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. Mixed effects logistic regression modelling was used to investigate the association between potential risk factors and RVFV seropositivity. The overall RVFV seroprevalence (n = 1,435) in domestic ruminants was 25.8% and speciesspecific seroprevalence was 29.7%, 27.7% and 22.0% in sheep (n = 148), cattle (n = 756) and goats (n = 531), respectively. The odds of seropositivity were significantly higher in animals sampled from the villages in the eastern than those in the western Rift Valley ecosystem (OR = 1.88, CI: 1.41, 2.51; p<0.001), in animals sampled from villages with soils of good than those with soils of poor water holding capacity (OR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.58, 3.02; p< 0.001), and in animals which had been introduced than in animals born within the herd (OR = 5.08, CI: 2.74, 9.44; p< 0.001). Compared with animals aged 1–2 years, those aged 3 and 4–5 years had 3.40 (CI: 2.49, 4.64; p< 0.001) and 3.31 (CI: 2.27, 4.82, p< 0.001) times the odds of seropositivity. The findings confirm exposure to RVFV in all the study villages, but with a higher prevalence in the study villages from the eastern Rift Valley ecosystem."

The results revealed that intestinal schistosomiasis, urogenital schistosomiasis, and STH infections are highly prevalent throughought the lake basin. The high prevalence of intestinal and urogenital schistosomisiasis in the study area was a function of the distance from Lake Victoria, the former being more prevalent at localities close to the lake, whilst the latter is more so away from it. Control of schistosomiasis and STHs in the study area requires an integrated strategy that involves provision of health education to communities, regular treatments, and provision of adequate safe water supply and sanitation facilities."

In Tanzania, TMs are frequently used to treat non-communicable diseases, yet little is known about TM practices for non-communicable diseases like diabetes. Methods Between December 2013 and June 2014, we assessed TM practices, including types, frequencies, reasons, and modes, among randomly selected community members. To further characterize TMs relevant for the local treatment of diabetes, we also conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews with key informants. ResultsWe enrolled 481 adults of whom 45 (9.4 %) had diabetes. The prevalence of TM use among individuals with diabetes was 77.1 % (95 % CI 58.5–89.0 %), and the prevalence of using TMs and biomedicines concurrently was 37.6 % (95 % CI 20.5–58.4 %). Many were using TMs specifically to treat diabetes (40.3 %; 95 % CI 20.5–63.9), and individuals with diabetes reported seeking healthcare from traditional healers, elders, family, friends, and herbal vendors. We identified several plant-based TMs used toward diabetes care: Moringa oleifera, Cymbopogon citrullus, Hagenia abyssinica, Aloe vera, Clausena anisata, Cajanus cajan, Artimisia afra, and Persea americana. ConclusionsTMs were commonly used for diabetes care in northern Tanzania. Individuals with diabetes sought healthcare advice from many sources, and several individuals used TMs and biomedicines together. The TMs commonly used by individuals with diabetes in northern Tanzania have a wide range of effects, and understanding them will more effectively shape biomedical practitices and public health policies that are patient-centered and sensitive to TM preferences."

To remain effective, the pyrethroid insecticide must withstand multiple washes over the lifetime of the net. ICON® Maxx is a ‘dip-it-yourself’ kit for long-lasting treatment of polyester nets. The twin-sachet kit contains a slow-release capsule suspension of lambda-cyhalothrin plus binding agent. To determine whether ICON Maxx meets the standards required by the World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES), the efficacy and wash fastness of ICON Maxx was evaluated against wild, free-flying anopheline mosquitoes. ICON Maxx was subjected to bioassay evaluation and experimental hut trial against pyrethroid-susceptible Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus. Mosquito mortality, blood feeding inhibition and personal protection were compared between untreated nets, conventional lambda-cyhalothrin treated nets (CTN) washed either four times (cut-off threshold) or 20 times, and ICON Maxx-treated nets either unwashed or washed 20 times. In bioassay, ICON Maxx demonstrated superior wash resistance to the CTN. In the experimental hut trial, ICON Maxx killed 75 % of An. funestus, 71 % of An. gambiae and 47 % of An. arabiensis when unwashed and 58, 66 and 42 %, respectively, when 20 times washed. The CTN killed 52 % of An. funestus, 33 % of An. gambiae and 30 % of An. arabiensis when washed to the cut-off threshold of four washes and 40, 40 and 36 %, respectively, when 20 times washed. Percentage mortality with ICON Maxx 20 times washed was similar (An. funestus) or significantly higher (An. gambiae, An. arabiensis) than with CTN washed to the WHOPES cut-off threshold. Blood-feeding inhibition with ICON Maxx 20 times washed was similar to the CTN washed to cut-off for all three species. Personal protection was significantly higher with ICON Maxx 20 times washed (66-79 %) than with CTN washed to cut-off (48-60 %). Nets treated with ICON Maxx and washed 20 times met the approval criteria set by WHOPES for Phase II trials in terms of mortality and blood-feeding inhibition. This finding raises the prospect of conventional polyester nets and other materials being made long-lastingly insecticidal through simple dipping in community or home, and thus represents a major advance over conventional pyrethroid treatments. (Less)"

This binding is mediated by members of the highly variant P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family. We have previously identified a subset of PfEMP1 proteins associated with severe malaria and found that the receptor for these PfEMP1 variants is endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). The binding is mediated through the amino-terminal cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR) of the subtypes ?1.1 and ?1.4 to ?1.8. In this study, we investigated the acquisition of anti-CIDR antibodies using plasma samples collected in four study villages with different malaria transmission intensities in northeastern Tanzania during a period with a decline in malaria transmission. We show that individuals exposed to high levels of malaria transmission acquire antibodies to EPCR-binding CIDR domains early in life and that these antibodies are acquired more rapidly than antibodies to other CIDR domains. The rate by which antibodies to EPCR-binding CIDR domains are acquired in populations in areas where malaria is endemic is determined by the malaria transmission intensity, and on a population level, the antibodies are rapidly lost if transmission is interrupted. This indicates that sustained exposure is required to maintain the production of the antibodies."

Results: Six discourses were delineated in relation to how people talked about HAS. Secrecy versus openness discourse describes the terms used when talking about HAS. “Other” discourse involved participants’ perception of HAS as something practiced by others unrelated to them and outside their communities. Acceptability/trendiness discourse: young women described HAS as something trendy and increasingly gaining acceptability in their communities. Materiality discourse: describes HAS as a practice that was more profitable than vaginal sex. Masculinity discourse involved discussions on men proving their manhood by engaging in HAS especially when women initiated the practice. Masculine attitudes were also reflected in how men described the practice using a language that would be considered crude. Public health discourse: describes HAS as riskier for HIV infection than vaginal sex. The reported use of condoms was low due to the perceptions that condoms were unsuitable for anal sex, but also perceptions among some participants that anal sex was safer than vaginal sex.

Discourse analysis was conducted with the aid of NVIVO versions 8 and 10 software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Results: Six discourses were delineated in relation to how people talked about HAS. Secrecy versus openness discourse describes the terms used when talking about HAS. “Other” discourse involved participants’ perception of HAS as something practiced by others unrelated to them and outside their communities. Acceptability/trendiness discourse: young women described HAS as something trendy and increasingly gaining acceptability in their communities. Materiality discourse: describes HAS as a practice that was more profitable than vaginal sex. Masculinity discourse involved discussions on men proving their manhood by engaging in HAS especially when women initiated the practice. Masculine attitudes were also reflected in how men described the practice using a language that would be considered crude. Public health discourse: describes HAS as riskier for HIV infection than vaginal sex.The reported use of condoms was low due to the perceptions that condoms were unsuitable for anal sex, but also perceptions among some participants that anal sex was safer than vaginal sex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Conclusion: Discourses among young women and adult men across the study populations were supportive of HAS. These findings provide useful insights in understanding how different population groups talked about HAS and offer a range of terms that interventions and further research on magnitude of HAS could draw on when addressing health risks of HAS among different study populations"

The study involved eight weeks of participant observation, 26 in-depth interviews, and 11 group discussions with young people aged 14-24 years, and 20 in-depth interviews and 6 group discussions with parents/carers of children in this age group. At an individual level, parenting and family structure were found to affect young people's sexual behaviour by influencing children's self-confidence and interactional competence, limiting discussion of sexual health and shaping economic provision for children, which in turn affected parental authority and daughters' engagement in risky sexual behaviour. Sexual norms are reproduced both through parents' explicit prohibitions and their own behaviours. Girls are socialised to accept men's superiority, which shapes their negotiation of sexual relationships. Interventions to improve young people's sexual and reproductive health should recognise the structural effects of parenting, both in terms of direct influences on children and the dynamics by which structural barriers such as gendered power relations and cultural norms around sexuality are transmitted across generations."

There is conflicting evidence regarding whether using ITNs and IRS in combination provides additional benefit over using either of these methods alone. This study investigated factors that may modify the effect of the combined use of IRS and ITNs compared to using ITNs alone on malaria infection prevalence. METHODS Secondary analysis was carried out on data from a cluster randomised trial in north-west Tanzania. 50 clusters received ITNs from a universal coverage campaign; of these 25 were randomly allocated to additionally receive two rounds of IRS in 2012. In cross-sectional household surveys children 0.5-14 years old were tested for Plasmodium falciparum infections (PfPR) two, six and ten months after the first IRS round. RESULTS IRS protected those sleeping under nets (OR = 0.38, 95%CI 0.26-0.57) and those who did not (OR = 0.43, 95%CI 0.29-0.63). The protective effect of IRS was not modified by community level ITN use (ITN use<50%, OR = 0.39, 95%CI 0.26-0.59; ITN use> = 50%, OR = 0.46, 95%CI 0.28-0.74). The additional protection from IRS was similar in low (<10% PfPR, OR = 0.38, 95%CI 0.19-0.75) and high transmission areas (?10% PfPR, OR = 0.34, 95%CI 0.18-0.67). ITN use was protective at the individual-level regardless of whether the village had been sprayed (OR = 0.83, 95%CI 0.70-0.98). Living in a sprayed village was protective regardless of whether the individual slept under an ITN last night (OR = 0.41, 95%CI 0.29-0.58). INTERPRETATION Implementing IRS in addition to ITNs was beneficial for individuals from villages with a wide range of transmission intensities and net utilisation levels. Net users received additional protection from IRS. ITNs were providing some individual protection, even in this area with high levels of pyrethroid insecticide resistance. These results demonstrate that there is a supplementary benefit of IRS even when ITNs are effective"

We assessed the association between anti-circumsporozoite antibody titres and the magnitude and duration of vaccine efficacy using data from a phase 3 trial done between 2009 and 2014.               Methods:Using data from 8922 African children aged 5–17 months and 6537 African infants aged 6–12 weeks at first vaccination, we analysed the determinants of immunogenicity after RTS,S/AS01 vaccination with or without a booster dose. We assessed the association between the incidence of clinical malaria and anti-circumsporozoite antibody titres using a model of anti-circumsporozoite antibody dynamics and the natural acquisition of protective immunity over time.                                                                                                                           Findings:RTS,S/AS01-induced anti-circumsporozoite antibody titres were greater in children aged 5–17 months than in those aged 6–12 weeks. Pre-vaccination anti-circumsporozoite titres were associated with lower immunogenicity in children aged 6–12 weeks and higher immunogenicity in those aged 5–17 months. The immunogenicity of the booster dose was strongly associated with immunogenicity after primary vaccination. Anti-circumsporozoite titres wane according to a biphasic exponential distribution. In participants aged 5–17 months, the half-life of the short-lived component of the antibody response was 45 days (95% credible interval 42–48) and that of the long-lived component was 591 days (557–632). After primary vaccination 12% (11–13) of the response was estimated to be long-lived, rising to 30% (28–32%) after a booster dose. An anti-circumsporozoite antibody titre of 121 EU/mL (98–153) was estimated to prevent 50% of infections. Waning anti-circumsporozoite antibody titres predict the duration of efficacy against clinical malaria across different age categories and transmission intensities, and efficacy wanes more rapidly at higher transmission intensity.                                                                                                                        Interpretation: Anti-circumsporozoite antibody titres are a surrogate of protection for the magnitude and duration of RTS,S/AS01 efficacy, with or without a booster dose, providing a valuable surrogate of effectiveness for new RTS,S formulations in the age groups considered.

In resource-restricted rural/semi-rural environments, identification of feasible screening tools is a priority. The objective of this study was to evaluate gestational anthropometry in relation to birth and infant growth in a rural/semi-rural Tanzanian prospective cohort of mothers and their infants. Methods Mothers (n = 114: 44 HIV-positive) attending antenatal clinic visits were recruited in their second or third trimester between March and November, 2012, and followed with their infants through 6-months post-partum. Demographic, clinical, and infant feeding data were obtained using questionnaires administered by a Swahili-speaking research nurse on demographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and infant feeding practices. Second or third trimester anthropometry (mid-upper arm circumference [MUAC], triceps skinfold thickness, weight, height), pregnancy outcomes, birth (weight, length, head circumference) and infant anthropometry (weight-for-age z-score [WAZ], length-for-age z-score [LAZ]) were obtained. Linear regression and mixed effect modeling were used to evaluate gestational factors in relation to pregnancy and infant outcomes. Results and discussion Gestational MUAC and maternal HIV status (HIV-positive mothers = 39 %) were associated with infant WAZ and LAZ from birth to 6-months in multivariate models, even after adjustment for infant feeding practices. The lowest gestational MUAC tertile was associated with lower WAZ throughout early infancy, as well as lower LAZ at 3 and 6-months. In linear mixed effects models through 6-months, each 1 cm increase in gestational MUAC was associated with a 0.11 increase in both WAZ (P < 0.001) and LAZ (P = 0.001). Infant HIV-exposure was negatively associated with WAZ (? = -0.65, P < 0.001) and LAZ (? = -0.49, P < 0.012) from birth to 6-months. Conclusions Lower gestational MUAC, evaluated using only a tape measure and minimal training that is feasible in non-urban clinic and community settings, was associated with lower infant anthropometric measurements. In this rural and semi-rural setting, HIV-exposure was associated with poorer anthropometry through 6-months despite maternal antiretroviral access. Routine assessment of MUAC has the potential to identify at-risk women in need of additional health interventions designed to optimize pregnancy outcomes and infant growth. Further research is needed to establish gestational MUAC reference ranges and to define interventions that successfully improve MUAC during pregnancy."

In African populations with HIV prevalence above 4%, between 30% and 81% of infected men and women have ever been tested for HIV. 5 Those who know they are HIV-positive may be willing to donate blood samples for research purposes but may not want to repeat pre-and post-test counselling. The same may be true of those who feel certain that they are uninfected. Sexually active men and women are encouraged to be tested regularly. Research studies should provide the option for those who arrange to be frequently retested – so-called repeat testers – to be given their test results in a short format and be allowed to opt out of post-test counselling. They should also be prepared for participants who do not wish to collect their test results in any format. All participants – including those who provide blood samples for research but opt out of post-test counselling – can be asked to report their testing histories and testing motives. Importantly, the opt-out provisions we discuss here align with the general principles of research ethics. We agree that there is public health utility in informing people of their HIV status but we think that this should not override the ethics of respect for individual autonomy. Informed consent procedures typically tell willing subjects that they have a right not to answer questions that make them uncomfortable and a right to withdraw from the study at any time without completing all the activities and procedures. Declining to receive a test result is an example of the right of participants to opt out of part of a study. Whether in research or clinical practice, public health utility would be better served through understanding peoples' reasons for not wanting to receive an HIV test result – while informing individuals about all of the available testing and counselling options. Rather than excluding those who decline post-test counselling , we have the obligation to understand the reasons for research participation – and non-participation – better, including attitudes to learning or confirming one's HIV status. Longitudinal studies with repeated HIV testing are particularly well placed to investigate decision-making around HIV testing. The results of such studies could demonstrate whether refusal to participate or receive test results lead to biased estimates of HIV prevalence that weaken the public health utility of the data. 6,7 They could also teach us about why and how people become motivated to be tested 8 and that knowledge could lead to improvements in the design of programmes of HIV testing.

Over the last decade youth friendly reproductive health services have been promoted and implemented world-wide. However, long term evidence of the impact of these programmes is lacking. We report the results of a large mystery client evaluation of adolescent sexual and reproductive health services in Tanzania, a country that has had a long established youth friendly policy. Forty-eight visits made to thirty-three health facilities were conducted by twelve young people (six in each region) trained to perform three different scripted scenarios (i.e., condom request, information on sexually transmitted infections and family planning). The study revealed barriers in relation to poor signage and reception for services. In addition health workers demonstrated paternalistic attitudes as well as lack of knowledge about adolescent sexual and reproductive health services. In some cases, health workers discouraged young people from using services such as condoms and family planning methods. Lack of confidentiality and privacy were also noted to be common challenges for the young people involved. Intervention strategies that focus on changing health workers' mind-set in relation to adolescent sexual and reproductive health are crucial for ensuring quality provision of sexual and reproductive health services to young people. The study identified the importance of reception or signs at the health units, as this can facilitate young people's efforts in seeking sexual and reproductive health services. Likewise, improvement of health workers knowledge of existing policy and practice on sexual and reproductive health services and youth friendly services is much needed."

The lengthy tuberculosis treatment duration and poor treatment outcomes associated with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are of major concern. The sparse new tuberculosis drug pipeline and widespread emergence of MDR-TB signal an urgent need for more innovative interventions to improve treatment outcomes. Building on the historical Pasteur-Bechamp debates on the role of the ""microbe"" vs the ""host internal milieu"" in disease causation, we make the case for parallel investments into host-directed therapies (HDTs). A range of potential HDTs are now available which require evaluation in randomized controlled clinical trials as adjunct therapies for shortening the duration of tuberculosis therapy and improving treatment outcomes for drug-susceptible tuberculosis and MDR-TB. Funder initiatives that may enable further research into HDTs are described."

Treatment success rates of MDR and XDR tuberculosis are still low and development of new, more effective tuberculosis drugs and adjunct therapies to improve treatment outcomes are urgently needed. Although standard therapy for drug-sensitive tuberculosis is highly effective, shorter, more effective treatment regimens are needed to reduce the burden of infectious cases. We review the latest WHO guidelines and global recommendations for treatment and management of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis, and provide an update on new drug development, results of several phase 2 and phase 3 tuberculosis treatment trials, and other emerging adjunct therapeutic options for MDR and XDR tuberculosis. The use of fluoroquinolone-containing (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) regimens have failed to shorten duration of therapy, and the new tuberculosis drug pipeline is sparse.

Since then, various studies have reported prevalences of up to 100% in some areas. However, for many years, there have been no sustainable control programmes and systematic data from observational and control studies are very limited in the public domain. To cover that gap, the present article reviews the epidemiology, malacology, morbidity, and the milestones the country has made in efforts to control schistosomiasis and discusses future control approaches. The available evidence indicates that, both urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis are still highly endemic in Tanzania and cause significant morbidity.Mass drug administration using praziquantel, currently used as a key intervention measure, has not been successful in decreasing prevalence of infection. There is therefore an urgent need to revise the current approach for the successful control of the disease. Clearly, these need to be integrated control measures."

We sought to investigate the potential for probiotic-supplemented yogurt to lower heavy metal levels in at-risk populations of pregnant women and in children in Mwanza, Tanzania, and to examine the microbiome in relation to toxin levels.

However, findings from sub-Saharan Africa have been mixed, particularly among HIV-negative persons. We explored associations between VCT use and changes in sexual risk behaviours and HIV incidence using data from a community HIV cohort study in northwest Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                     METHODS:Data on VCT use, sexual behaviour and HIV status were available from three HIV serological surveillance rounds undertaken in 2003-4 (Sero4), 2006-7 (Sero5) and 2010 (Sero6). We used multinomial logistic regression to assess changes in sexual risk behaviours between rounds, and Poisson regression to estimate HIV incidence.                                 RESULTS:The analyses included 3,613 participants attending Sero4 and Sero5 (3,474 HIV-negative and 139 HIV-positive at earlier round) and 2,998 attending Sero5 and Sero6 (2,858 HIV-negative and 140 HIV-positive at earlier round). Among HIV-negative individuals VCT use was associated with reductions in the number of sexual partners in the last year (aRR Seros 4-5: 1.42, 95% CI 1.07-1.88; aRR Seros 5-6: 1.68, 95% CI 1.25-2.26) and in the likelihood of having a non-cohabiting partner in the last year (aRR Seros 4-5: 1.57, 95% CI 1.10-2.25; aRR Seros 5-6: 1.48, 95% CI 1.07-2.04) or a high-risk partner in the last year (aRR Seros 5-6 1.57, 95% CI 1.06-2.31). However, VCT was also associated with stopping using condoms with non-cohabiting partners between Seros 4-5 (aRR 4.88, 95% CI 1.39-17.16). There were no statistically significant associations between VCT use and changes in HIV incidence, nor changes in sexual behaviour among HIV-positive individuals, possibly due to small sample sizes.                                                                                                                                                                        CONCLUSIONS:We found moderate associations between VCT use and reductions in some sexual risk behaviours among HIV-negative participants, but no impacts among HIV-positive individuals in the context of low overall VCT uptake. Furthermore, there were no significant changes in HIV incidence associated with VCT use, although declining background incidence and small sample sizes may have prevented us from detecting this. The impact of VCT services will ultimately depend upon rates of uptake, with further research required to better understand processes of behaviour change following VCT use."

However, regions where helminth parasites are endemic record much lower prevalences of allergies and autoimmune diseases, suggesting that parasites may protect against immunopathological syndromes. Most helminth diseases are spectral in nature, with a large proportion of relatively asymptomatic cases and a subset of patients who develop severe pathologies. The maintenance of the asymptomatic state is now recognized as reflecting an immunoregulatory environment, which may be promoted by parasites, and involves multiple levels of host regulatory cells and cytokines; a breakdown of this regulation is observed in pathological disease. Currently, there is much interest in whether helminth-associated immune regulation may ameliorate allergy and autoimmunity, with investigations in both laboratory models and human trials. Understanding and exploiting the interactions between these parasites and the host regulatory network are therefore likely to highlight new strategies to control both infectious and immunological diseases."

In sub-Saharan Africa high incidences of malaria have contributed to self-medication with anti-malarial drugs. In recent years, there has been a gain in malaria control, which has led to decreased malaria transmission, morbidity and mortality. Therefore, understanding the patterns of self-medication during this period when most instances of fever are presumed to be due to non-malaria febrile illnesses is important. In this study, self-medication practice was assessed among community members and information on the habit of self-medication was gathered from health workers. Methods Twelve focus group discussions (FGD) with members of communities and 14 in-depth interviews (IDI) with health workers were conducted in Kilosa district, Tanzania. The transcripts were coded into different categories by MaxQDA software and then analysed through thematic content analysis. Results The study revealed that self-medication was a common practice among FGD participants. Anti-malarial drugs including sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and quinine were frequently used by the participants for treatment of fever. Study participants reported that they visited health facilities following failure of self-medication or if there was no significant improvement after self-medication. The common reported reasons for self-medication were shortages of drugs at health facilities, long waiting time at health facilities, long distance to health facilities, inability to pay for health care charges and the freedom to choose the preferred drugs. Conclusion This study demonstrated that self-medication practice is common among rural communities in the study area. The need for community awareness is emphasized for correct and comprehensive information about drawbacks associated with self-medication practices. Deliberate efforts by the government and other stakeholders to improve health care services, particularly at primary health care facilities will help to reduce self-medication practices."

Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated the importance of non-malaria fevers, which have significantly improved our understanding of etiologies of febrile illnesses.

RESULTS: The study revealed that the awareness of the study participants on non-malaria febrile illnesses was low and many community members believed that most instances of fever are due to malaria. In addition, the majority had inappropriate beliefs about the possible causes of fever. In most cases, non-malaria febrile illnesses were considered following a negative Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test (mRDT) result or persistent fevers after completion of anti-malaria dosage. Therefore, in the absence of mRDTs, there is over diagnosis of malaria and under diagnosis of non-malaria illnesses. Shortages of diagnostic facilities for febrile illnesses including mRDTs were repeatedly reported as a major barrier to proper diagnosis and treatment of febrile patients.

The lack of diagnostic facilities in developing countries leads to failure to estimate the true burden of such illnesses, and generally the diseases are underreported. These diseases may have similar symptoms with other causes of acute febrile illnesses including malaria and hence clinical diagnosis without laboratory tests can be difficult. This study aimed to identify viral etiologies as a cause of fever in children and their co-infections with malaria. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted for 6 months at Kilosa district hospital, Tanzania. The participants were febrile children aged 2–13 years presented at the outpatient department. Diagnostic tests such as IgM and IgG ELISA, and PCR were used. Results: A total of 364 patients were enrolled, of these 83(22.8%) had malaria parasites, 76 (20.9%) had presumptive acute dengue infection and among those, 29(38.2%) were confirmed cases. Dengue was more likely to occur in children ? 5 years than in &lt;5 years (OR 2.28, 95% CI: 1.35–3.86). Presumptive acute Chikungunya infection was identified in 17(4.7%) of patients. We observed no presenting symptoms that distinguished patients with Chikungunya infection from those with dengue infection or malaria. Co-infections between malaria and Chikungunya, malaria and dengue fever as well as Chikungunya and dengue were detected. Most patients with Chikungunya and dengue infections were treated with antibacterials. Furthermore, our results revealed that 5(5.2%) of patients had influenza virus while 5(12.8%) had rotavirus and 2(5.1%) had adenovirus. Conclusion: Our results suggest that even though viral diseases are a major public health concern, they are not given due recognition as a cause of fever in febrile patients. Emphasis on laboratory diagnostic tests for proper diagnosis and management of febrile patients is recommended."

Advantages of this diagnostic include the ease of sample collection and test methods. However, as with most new TB diagnostics, LAM tests have been evaluated in well-controlled laboratory settings and subsequently need assessment under real working conditions. Our experience showed that the diagnosis of TB using the detection of LAM in urine under field conditions is prone to false-positive results due to contamination. Dust and soil, but also stool, seemed to lead to increased OD values and thus false-positive results of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for LAM; however, contamination with blood, as well as bacterial or fungal organisms, had no influence. The collection of urine for the detection of LAM should therefore follow strict collection criteria in order to avoid contamination."

Although the pathophysiological mechanisms are not fully understood, the immune system is weakened in diabetes patients and therefore the validity of interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) may be compromised. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between diabetes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen-specific interferon gamma (IFN-?) release in a TB endemic area among culture-confirmed TB patients and non-TB controls.                                                                                                                 METHODS: Culture-confirmed pulmonary TB patients (n = 187) and healthy non-TB neighbourhood controls (n = 190) from Mwanza, Tanzania were tested for the presence of circulating T cells recognizing Mtb antigens using an IGRA. The diabetes status of all participants was assessed using a standard oral glucose tolerance test. The impact of diabetes on the performance of the IGRA was estimated using robust linear and logistic regression.                                                                                                                                                                             RESULTS: Compared to normal glucose tolerance, diabetes was associated with reduced levels of Mtb-specific IFN-?. Increasing levels of fasting blood glucose (B - 0.3, 95% confidence interval - 0.6 to - 0.03, p = 0.033) was negatively associated with IFN-?. Although TB patients had higher specific and lower unspecific mitogen IFN-? responses compared to non-TB controls, the association between diabetes and IFN-? did not depend on TB status.

The majority of these infections were not diagnosed by the corresponding syndrome; therefore, most participants were not treated at the diagnosis visit. Syndromic management was poorly predictive of laboratory-diagnosed infections. We identified a number of risk factors for STIs, including low educational level, some sexual behaviours, and ever having been pregnant.

An existing early malaria epidemic prediction model required further development, validations and automation before its wide use and application in the region. The model has a lead-time of two to four months between the detection of the epidemic signal and the evolution of the epidemic. The validated models would be of great use in the early detection and prevention of malaria epidemics. Confirmed inpatient malaria data were collected from eight sites in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda for the period 1995-2009. Temperature and rainfall data for the period 1960-2009 were collected from meteorological stations closest to the source of the malaria data. Process-based models were constructed for computing the risk of an epidemic in two general highland ecosystems using temperature and rainfall data. The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive power were used to validate the models. Depending on the availability and quality of the malaria and meteorological data, the models indicated good functionality at all sites. Only two sites in Kenya had data that met the criteria for the full validation of the models. The additive model was found most suited for the poorly drained U-shaped valley ecosystems while the multiplicative model was most suited for the well-drained V-shaped valley ecosystem. The +18°C model was adaptable to any of the ecosystems and was designed for conditions where climatology data were not available. The additive model scored 100% for sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive power. The multiplicative model had a sensitivity of 75% specificity of 99% and a positive predictive power of 86%. The additive and multiplicative models were validated and were shown to be robust and with high climate-based, early epidemic predictive power. They are designed for use in the common, well- and poorly drained valley ecosystems in the highlands of East Africa. "

DESIGNThe validated Stop TB patient cost questionnaire was adapted and used in interviews with 190 patients in the continuation phase of treatment with current regimens. RESULTSIn both countries, overall patient costs were lower during 2 months of the continuation phase (US$74 in Tanzania and US$56 in Bangladesh) than during the 2 months of the intensive phase of treatment (US$150 and US$111, respectively). However, continuation phase patient costs still represented 89% and 77% of the 2-month average national income in the respective countries. Direct travel costs in some settings were kept low by local delivery system features such as community treatment observation. Lost productivity and costs for supplementary foods remained significant. CONCLUSIONS Although it is not a straightforward exercise to determine the exact magnitude of likely savings, a shorter regimen would reduce out-of-pocket expenses incurred by patients in the most recent 2 months of the continuation phase and allow an earlier return to productive activities."

Studies using vignettes in the developing world are emerging, but with no critical examination of their usefulness in such settings. We describe the development and application of vignettes to a qualitative investigation of barriers to uptake of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) HIV services in rural Tanzania in 2012, and critique the successes and challenges of using the technique in this setting. Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) group activities (3 male; 3 female groups from Kisesa, north-west Tanzania) were used to develop a vignette representing realistic experiences of an HIV-infected pregnant woman in the community. The vignette was discussed during in-depth interviews with 16 HIV-positive women, 3 partners/ relatives, and 5 HIV-negative women who had given birth recently. A critical analysis was applied to assess the development, implementation and usefulness of the vignette. The majority of in-depth interviewees understood the concept of the vignette and felt the story was realistic, although the story or questions needed repeating in some cases. In-depth interviewers generally applied the vignette as intended, though occasionally were unsure whether to steer the conversation back to the vignette character when participants segued into personal experiences. Interviewees were occasionally confused by questions and responded with what the character should do rather than would do; also confusing fieldworkers and presenting difficulties for researchers in interpretation. Use of the vignette achieved the main objectives, putting most participants at ease and generating data on barriers to PMTCT service uptake. Participants' responses to the vignette often reflected their own experience (revealed later in the interviews). Participatory group research is an effective method for developing vignettes. A vignette was incorporated into qualitative interview discussion guides and used successfully in rural Africa to draw out barriers to PMTCT service use; vignettes may also be valuable in HIV, health service use and drug adherence research in this setting. Application of this technique can prove challenging for fieldworkers, so thorough training should be provided prior to its use."

This study explores how patient-provider relations influence PMTCT service use in four government facilities in Kisesa, Tanzania. Qualitative data were collected in 2012 through participatory group activities with community members (3 male, 3 female groups), in-depth interviews with 21 women who delivered recently (16 HIV-positive), 9 health providers, and observations in antenatal clinics. Data were transcribed, translated into English and analysed with NVIVO9 using an adapted theoretical model of patient-centred care. Three themes emerged: decision-making processes, trust, and features of care. There were few examples of shared decision-making, with a power imbalance in favour of providers, although they offered substantial psycho-social support. Unclear communication by providers, and patients not asking questions, resulted in missed services. Omission of pre-HIV test counselling was often noted, influencing women's ability to opt-out of HIV testing. Trust in providers was limited by confidentiality concerns, and some HIV-positive women were anxious about referrals to other facilities after establishing trust in their original provider. Good care was recounted by some women, but many (HIV-positive and negative) described disrespectful staff including discrimination of HIV-positive patients and scolding, particularly during delivery; exacerbated by lack of materials (gloves, sheets) and associated costs, which frustrated staff. Experienced or anticipated negative staff behaviour influenced adherence to subsequent PMTCT components. Findings revealed a pivotal role for patient-provider relations in PMTCT service use. Disrespectful treatment and lack of informed consent for HIV testing require urgent attention by PMTCT programme managers. Strategies should address staff behaviour, emphasizing ethical standards and communication, and empower patients to seek information about available services. Optimising provider-patient relations can improve uptake of maternal health services more broadly, and ART adherence."

Despite WHO recommendations for active case finding among people who inject drugs (PWID), few studies have been published. The historical focus of case finding has been in populations that are human immunodeficiency virus-positive, incarcerated or at higher occupational risk. OBJECTIVE We sought to examine the yield of active case finding among PWID newly started on methadone in Tanzania. DESIGNOf 222 methadone clients, 156 (70%) met with study administrators; 150 consented to participate, 139 (93%) of whom were male. The median age was 34 years. A symptom-based questionnaire was developed by the investigators and administered to every consenting patient by a native Swahili speaker. RESULTSOf the 150 patients surveyed, 16 (11%) had one or more TB symptoms and were referred for laboratory testing. Six new TB cases were identified in this active case finding program, with a prevalence of 4%. CONCLUSION This study presents the first data on TB prevalence in a population of PWID in Tanzania. This prevalence is 23 times that of the general Tanzanian TB prevalence of 0.2%. These results have significant implications for TB control."

We hypothesised that reproductive health education and services for young females are inaccessible and conducted this study to gain insights into their perceptions of sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and barriers to reproductive health service utilisation in rural Mwanza, Tanzania. We conducted nine focus group among pregnant adolescents aged 15 -20 years. Data was transcribed, translated, and coded for relevant themes using NVivo10 software for qualitative data analysis. Most participants were aware of the dangers of STIs to themselves and their unborn babies, but did not perceive themselves as at risk of acquiring STIs. They viewed condoms as ineffective for preventing STIs and pregnancies and unnecessary for those in committed relationships. Stigma, and long waiting times and lack of privacy in the clinics discouraged young females from seeking reproductive healthcare. Reproductive healthcare for young females who are not pregnant is practically nonexistent in Tanzania. Healthcare access for pregnant young women is also limited. Targeted changes to increase clinic accessibility and to provide reproductive health education to all rather than only pregnant women have the potential to address these gaps.

RESULTS: A total of 203 children were included. The median age was 3.0 years (interquartile range: 1.2-7.0), 38% were HIV infected, 36% were aged <2 years, and 58% had a low weight-for-age. IP-10 and QFT-IT test performance was comparable but sensitivity was low: 33% (1 of 3) in children with confirmed TB and 29% (8 of 28) in children with probable TB. Rates of indeterminate responders were high: 29% (59 of 203) for IP-10 and 26% (53 of 203) for QFT-IT. Age <2 years was associated with indeterminate test outcome for both IP-10 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.2; P = .02) and QFT-IT (aOR: 2.4; P = .01). TB exposure was associated with positive IP-10 test outcome (aOR: 3.6; P = .01) but not with positive QFT-IT outcome (aOR 1.4; P = .52). In 102 adults, test sensitivity was 80% for both tests (P = .248).

Little research has been done on HPV prevalence in girls who report not having passed sexual debut in high HPV-prevalence countries.  METHODS: Using attendance registers of randomly selected primary schools in the Mwanza region of Tanzania, we enrolled girls aged 15-16 years who reported not having passed sexual debut. A face-to-face interview on sexual behavior and intravaginal practices, and a nurse-assisted self-administered vaginal swab were performed. Swabs were tested for 13 high-risk and 24 low-risk HPV genotypes. RESULTS: HPV was detected in 40/474 (8.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9-11.0) girls. Ten different high-risk and 21 different low-risk genotypes were detected. High-risk genotypes were detected in 5.3% (95% CI, 3.5-7.8). In multivariable analysis, only intravaginal cleansing (practiced by 20.9%) was associated with HPV detection (adjusted odds ratio = 2.19, 95% CI, 1.09-4.39).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CONCLUSION:This cohort of adolescent Tanzanian girls had a high HPV prevalence prior to self-reported sexual debut, and this was associated with intravaginal cleansing. This most likely reflects underreporting of sexual activity, and it is possible that intravaginal cleansing is a marker for unreported sexual debut or nonpenetrative sexual behaviors."

However, no documented statistics exist for their contribution in the management of mosquitoes and other insects except through verbal and some publications. This study aimed at assessing communities’ knowledge, attitudes and practices of using plants as an alternative method for mosquito control among selected communities in a malaria-prone area in Tanzania. Methods Questionnaires were administered to 202 respondents from four villages of Bagamoyo District, Pwani Region, in Tanzania followed by participatory rural appraisal with village health workers. Secondary data collection for plants mentioned by the communities was undertaken using different search engines such as googlescholar, PubMED and NAPRALERT. Results Results showed about 40.3% of respondents used plants to manage insects, including mosquitoes. A broad profile of plants are used, including “mwarobaini” (Azadirachta indica) (22.5%), “mtopetope” (Annona spp) (20.8%), “mchungwa/mlimau” (Citrus spp) (8.3%), “mvumbashi/uvumbati” (Ocimum spp) (7.4%), “mkorosho” (Anacadium occidentale) (7.1%), “mwembe” (5.4%) (Mangifera indica), “mpera” (4.1%) (Psidium spp) and “maganda ya nazi” (4.1%) (Cocos nucifera). Majority of respondents collected these plants from the wild (54.2%), farms (28.9%) and/or home gardens (6%). The roles played by these plants in fighting mosquitoes is reflected by the majority that deploy them with or without bed-nets (p > 0.55) or insecticidal sprays (p >0.22). Most respondents were aware that mosquitoes transmit malaria (90.6%) while few respondents associated elephantiasis/hydrocele (46.5%) and yellow fever (24.3%) with mosquitoes. Most of the ethnobotanical uses mentioned by the communities were consistent with scientific information gathered from the literature, except for Psidium guajava, which is reported for the first time in insect control. Conclusion This survey has indicated some knowledge gap among community members in managing mosquito vectors using plant. The communities need a basic health education and sensitization for effective exploitation of this valuable tool for reducing mosquitoes and associated disease burdens. On the other hand, the government of Tanzania should strengthen advocacy of botanical pesticides development, registration and regulation for public health benefits because they are source of pest control tools people rely on them."

A cohort of 100 TB patients (58 men; median age, 35 [interquartile range {IQR}, 29 to 40] years, and median body mass index [BMI], 18.8 [17.3 to 19.9] kg/m(2)) were randomized to receive nutritional supplementation during the intensive phase of TB treatment. Rifampin plasma concentrations were determined after 1 week and 2 months of treatment. The effects of nutritional supplementation, HIV, time on treatment, body weight, and SLCO1B1 rs4149032 genotype were examined using a population pharmacokinetic model. The model adjusted for body size via allometric scaling, accounted for clearance autoinduction, and detected an increase in bioavailability (+14%) for the patients in the continuation phase. HIV coinfection in patients not receiving the supplementation was found to decrease bioavailability by 21.8%, with a median maximum concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24) of 5.6 ?g/ml and 28.6 ?g · h/ml, respectively. HIV-coinfected patients on nutritional supplementation achieved higher Cmax and AUC0-24 values of 6.4 ?g/ml and 31.6 ?g · h/ml, respectively, and only 13.3% bioavailability reduction. No effect of the SLCO1B1 rs4149032 genotype was observed. In conclusion, nutritional supplementation during the first 2 months of TB treatment reduces the decrease in rifampin exposure observed in HIV-coinfected patients but does not affect exposure in HIV-uninfected patients. If confirmed in other studies, the use of defined nutritional supplementation in HIV-coinfected TB patients should be considered in TB control programs.

Assaying these makers is of paramount importance in the resistance monitoring programme. We investigated the presence and distribution of knock-down resistance (kdr) mutations in Anopheles gambiae s.l. in Tanzania. Methods: Indoor-resting Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 10 sites and tested for insecticide resistance using the standard WHO protocol. Polymerase chain reaction-based molecular diagnostics were used to genotype mosquitoes and detect kdr mutations. Results: The An. gambiae tested were resistance to lambdacyhalothrin in Muheza, Arumeru and Muleba. Out of 350 An. gambiae s.l. genotyped, 35% were An. gambiae s.s. and 65% An. arabiensis. L1014S and L1014F mutations were detected in both An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis. L1014S point mutation was found at the allelic frequency of 4-33%, while L1014F was at the allelic frequency 6-41%. The L1014S mutation was much associated with An. gambiae s.s.

Conclusion: The observed co-occurrence of L1014S and L1014F mutations coupled with reports of insecticide resistance in the country suggest that pyrethroid resistance is becoming a widespread phenomenon among our malaria vector populations. The presence of L1014F mutation in this East African mosquito population indicates the spreading of this gene across Africa. The potential operational implications of these findings on malaria control need further exploration."

Being aged >40 years (AOR = 2.52, 95% CI 1.37-4.63), abnormal waist circumference (AOR = 2.37 95% CI 1.13-5.00), overweight/obesity (AOR = 2.71, 95% CI 1.26-5.84) and male sex (AOR = 1.17, 1.02-4.20) were the predictors of hypertension among patients on ART while raised TC (AOR = 1.47 (1.01-2.21) and being aged >40 years (AOR = 3.42, 95% CI 2.06-5.70) were predictors for hypertension among ART naïve patients.                                                                                    Conclusion:This study has revealed that the magnitude of NCD risk factors is significantly higher among PLWHIV on ART than those not on ART. Initiating and strengthening of interventions for minimizing preventable NCD risks should be considered when initiating ART among PLWHIV. Regular monitoring of NCD risk factors is of paramount importance among ART patients."

Free HIV care including ART has been available since 2005. Event history analysis was used to compare mortality rates among HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults in the 5-year period before and after the introduction of ART. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using exponential regression models. Interaction between time period and HIV status was assessed to investigate whether there was a non-linear relationship between these two variables. results Male and female mortality patterns varied over the pre- and post-ART period. In women, the crude death rate fell for both HIV negatives and HIV positives hazard rate ratio (HRR = 0.71; 95%CI 0.51–0.99 and HRR = 0.68; 95%CI: 0.46–0.99, respectively). For men, the mortality among the HIV negatives increased (HRR = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.06–2.03) while the decline in mortality among the HIV positives (HRR = 0.77; 95%CI 0.52–1.13) was not statistically significant. The largest decrease in HIV-positive mortality over the two periods was among the 30- to 44-year-old age group for women and among the 45- to 59-year-old age group for men. conclusion There has been a modest effect on mortality in the study population following the introduction of free ART 5 years ago. Improving access to treatment and placing greater focus on retaining individuals on treatment are essential if the full potential of treatment for reducing HIV-related mortality is to be realised"

It often leads to loss of productive labour and disruption of existing social support system which results in deterioration of population health. This poses a great challenge to infected people in meeting their essential goods and services. This paper examines health and social support services provided by employers to HIV/AIDS infected employees in Tanzania. Methods This was a cross-sectional study, which employed qualitative and quantitative methods in data collection and analysis. Structured questionnaires and in-depth interviews were used to assess the health and social support services provision at employers and employees perspectives. The study participants were employees and employers from public and private organizations. Results A total of 181 employees and 23 employers from 23 workplaces aged between 18–68 years were involved. The results show that 23.8% (i.e., 20.4% males and 27.3% females) of the employees had at least one member of the family or close relatives living with HIV at the time of the study. Fifty six percent of the infected employees reported to have been receiving health or social support from their employers. Employees’ responses were consistent with those reported by their employers. A total of 12(52.2%) and 11(47.8%) employers reported to have been providing health and social supports respectively. Female employees (58.3%) from the private sector (60.0%) were more likely to receive supports than male employees (52.6%) and than those from the public sector (46.2%). The most common health and social support received by the employees were treatment, and nutritional support and reduction of workload, respectively. Conclusions HIV/AIDS infected employees named treatment and nutritional support, and soft loans and reduced workload respectively, as the most important health and social supports they needed from their employers. This study provides baseline information for further studies on provision of health and social support services by employers to HIV/AIDS infected employees in the context of a developing economy like Tanzania."

Although access to health services in Tanzania is improved, still many people seek medical care when it is too late or not at all. This study aimed to determine factors associated with delay in seeking treatment for fever among children under five in Tanzania. A three-stage cluster sampling design was used to sample households with children under five in Dodoma region, central Tanzania between October 2010 and January 2011. Information on illness and health-seeking behaviours in the previous four weeks was collected using a structured questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate determinants of delay in treatment-seeking behaviour while accounting for sample design. A total of 287 under-five children with fever whose caretakers sought medical care were involved in the study. Of these, 55.4% were taken for medical care after 24 hours of onset of fever. The median time of delay in fever care seeking was two days. Children who lived with both biological parents were less likely to be delayed for medical care compared to those with either one or both of their biological parents absent from home (OR?=?0.42, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.74). Children from households with two to three under-five children were more likely to be delayed for medical care compared to children from households with only one child (OR?=?1.54, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.26). Also, children living in a distance ?5 kilometres from the nearest health facility were about twice (95% CI: 1.11, 2.72) as likely to delay to be taken for medical care than those in the shorter distances. Living with non-biological parents, high number of under-fives in household, and long distance to the nearest health facility were important factors for delay in seeking healthcare. Programmes to improve education on equity in social services, family planning, and access to health facilities are required for better healthcare and development of children. (Less)"

After deployment of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) there have been reports of reduced sensitivity to ACT by malaria parasites in South-East Asia. In Tanzania, artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) is the recommended first-line drug in treatment of uncomplicated malaria. This study surveyed the distribution of the Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance protein-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased parasite tolerance to ALu, in Tanzania. A total of 687 Plasmodium falciparum positive dried blood spots on filter paper and rapid diagnostic test strips collected by finger pricks from patients attending health facilities in six regions of Tanzania mainland between June 2010 and August 2011 were used. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique was used to detect Pfmdr1 SNPs N86Y, Y184F and D1246Y. There were variations in the distribution of Pfmdr1 polymorphisms among regions. Tanga region had exceptionally high prevalence of mutant alleles, while Mbeya had the highest prevalence of wild type alleles. The haplotype YFY was exclusively most prevalent in Tanga (29.6%) whereas the NYD haplotype was the most prevalent in all other regions. Excluding Tanga and Mbeya, four, most common Pfmdr1 haplotypes did not vary between the remaining four regions (?2 =?2.3, p =?0.512). The NFD haplotype was the second most prevalent haplotype in all regions, ranging from 17% - 26%. This is the first country-wide survey on Pfmdr1 mutations associated with ACT resistance. Distribution of individual Pfmdr1 mutations at codons 86, 184 and 1246 varies throughout Tanzanian regions. There is a general homogeneity in distribution of common Pfmdr1 haplotypes reflecting strict implementation of ALu policy in Tanzania with overall prevalence of NFD haplotype ranging from 17 to 26% among other haplotypes. With continuation of ALu as first-line drug this haplotype is expected to keep rising, thus there is need for continued pharmacovigilance studies to monitor any delayed parasite clearance by the drug."

In Tanzania, these infections are a major public health problem particularly in school and pre-school children. The current study investigated malaria and helminth co-infections and anaemia in school and pre-school children in Magu district, Tanzania.                                                                                                   Methodology: School and pre-school children were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Stool samples were examined for Schistosoma mansoni and STH infections using Kato Katz technique. Urine samples were examined for Schistosoma haematobium using the urine filtration method. Blood samples were examined for malaria parasites and haemoglobin concentrations using the Giemsa stain and Haemoque methods, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                            Principal Findings: Out of 1,546 children examined, 1,079 (69.8%) were infected with one or more parasites. Malaria-helminth co-infections were observed in 276 children (60% of all children with P. falciparum infection). Malaria parasites were significantly more prevalent in hookworm infected children than in hookworm free children (p?=?0.046). However, this association was non-significant on multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR?=?1.320, p?=?0.064). Malaria parasite density decreased with increasing infection intensity of S. mansoni and with increasing number of co-infecting helminth species. Anaemia prevalence was 34.4% and was significantly associated with malaria infection, S. haematobium infection and with multiple parasite infections. Whereas S. mansoni infection was a significant predictor of malaria parasite density, P. falciparum and S. haematobium infections were significant predictors of anaemia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Conclusions/Significance: These findings suggest that multiple parasite infections are common in school and pre-school children in Magu district. Concurrent P. falciparum, S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections increase the risk of lower Hb levels and anaemia, which in turn calls for integrated disease control interventions. The associations between malaria and helminth infections detected in this study need further investigation."

Treatment coverages are however often suboptimal for programmes to reach the goal of transmission interruption within reasonable time. The present study aimed to identify predictors and barriers to individual drug uptake during MDA implementation by the National LF Elimination Programme in Tanzania.                                                                  Methods: A questionnaire based cross sectional household survey was carried out in two rural and two urban districts in Lindi and Morogoro regions shortly after the 2011 MDA. 3279 adults (?15 years) were interviewed about personal characteristics, socio-economic status, MDA drug uptake among themselves and their children, reasons for taking/not taking drugs, and participation in previous MDA activities for LF control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Findings: The overall drug uptake rate was 55.1% (range of 44.5–75.6% between districts). There was no overall major difference between children (54.8%) and adults (55.2%) or between females (54.9%) and males (55.8%), but the role of these and other predictors varied to some extent between study sites. Major overall predictors of drug uptake among the interviewed adults were increasing age and history of previous drug uptake. Being absent from home during drug distribution was the main reason for not taking the drugs (50.2%) followed by clinical contraindications to treatment (10.8%), missing household visits of drug distributors (10.6%), and households not being informed about the distribution (9.0%).   Conclusion: Drug uptake relied more on easily modifiable provider-related factors than on individual perceptions and practices in the target population. Limited investments in appropriate timing, dissemination of accurate timing information to recipients and motivation of drug distributors to visit all households (repeatedly when residents are absent) are likely to have considerable potential for increasing drug uptake, in support of successful LF transmission elimination."

Microencapsulated (MC) DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is a formulation of the popular repellent, which gives long lasting activity when applied to nets. Its suitability for IRS use has not been evaluated before. This study assessed the efficacy of DEET MC, for IRS in experimental huts. DEET MC was tested alongside standard repellent and non-repellent residual insecticides: lambdacyhalothrin, permethrin, pirimiphos methyl and DDT. Residual formulations of these compounds were sprayed on plywood panels attached to walls of experimental huts to assess efficacy against pyrethroid resistant, wild free-flying Anopheles arabiensis and Culex quinquefasciatus. The panel treatments were rotated weekly between huts. The overall mortalities of An. arabiensis induced by the various treatments (range: 76-86%) were significantly greater than mortality in the untreated control (8%, P?<?0.001). Mortality of An. arabiensis in DEET sprayed huts (82%) was higher than in lambdacyhalothrin CS (76%, P?=?0.043) but not significantly different to pirimiphos methyl CS (86%, P?=?0.204) or DDT huts (81%, P?=?0.703). Against Cx. quinquefasciatus DEET MC was less effective, inducing lower mortality (29%) than other treatments. An arabiensis blood feeding rates were higher in the unsprayed control (34%) than in sprayed huts (range between treatments: 19-22%, P?<?0.002), and DEET provided equivalent or superior blood feeding inhibition (44%) to other insecticides. Against Cx. quinquefasciatus there was no significant reduction in blood-feeding for any treatment relative to the control. There was a significantly higher exiting of An. arabiensis from huts sprayed with DEET (98%), lambdacyhalothrin (98%) and permethrin (96%) relative to the control (80%, P?<?0.01). Exiting rates of Cx. quinquefasciatus did not differ between treatment huts and the control. Microencapsulated DEET acts like an insecticide at ambient temperature and induces mosquito mortality when applied to walls made from wooden panels. This trial demonstrated the potential of microencapsulated DEET to control An. arabiensis and warrants further studies of residual activity on interior substrates. "

The purpose of this paper is to describe the protocol of a randomized factorial study designed to address this research gap. This project will evaluate two malaria control interventions in Mvomero District, Tanzania: (1) a disease management strategy involving early detection and treatment by community health workers using rapid diagnostic technology; and (2) vector control through community-supported larviciding. Six study villages were assigned to each of four groups (control, early detection and treatment, larviciding, and early detection and treatment plus larviciding). The primary endpoint of interest was change in malaria infection prevalence across the intervention groups measured during annual longitudinal cross-sectional surveys. Recurring entomological surveying, household surveying, and focus group discussions will provide additional valuable insights. At baseline, 962 households across all 24 villages participated in a household survey; 2,884 members from 720 of these households participated in subsequent malariometric surveying. The study design will allow us to estimate the effect sizes of different intervention mixtures. Careful documentation of our study protocol may also serve other researchers designing field-based intervention trials."

However, as with most new TB diagnostics, LAM tests have been evaluated in well-controlled laboratory settings and subsequently need assessment under real working conditions. Our experience showed that the diagnosis of TB using the detection of LAM in urine under field conditions is prone to false-positive results due to contamination. Dust and soil, but also stool, seemed to lead to increased OD values and thus false-positive results of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for LAM; however, contamination with blood, as well as bacterial or fungal organisms, had no influence. The collection of urine for the detection of LAM should therefore follow strict collection criteria in order to avoid contamination."

Yet, stemming from a lack of appropriate national survey data, no large-scale comparative study of Maasai child health has been conducted. Savannas Forever Tanzania surveyed the health of over 3500 children from 56 villages in northern Tanzania between 2009 and 2011. The major ethnic groups sampled were the Maasai, Sukuma, Rangi, and the Meru. Using multilevel regression we compare each ethnic group on the basis of (i) measurements of child health, including anthropometric indicators of nutritional status and self-reported incidence of disease; and (ii) important proximate determinants of child health, including food insecurity, diet, breastfeeding behaviour and vaccination coverage. We then (iii) contrast households among the Maasai by the extent to which subsistence is reliant on livestock herding. Measures of both child nutritional status and disease confirm that the Maasai are substantially disadvantaged compared to neighbouring ethnic groups, Meru are relatively advantaged, and Rangi and Sukuma intermediate in most comparisons. However, Maasai children were less likely to report malaria and worm infections. Food insecurity was high throughout the study site, but particularly severe for the Maasai, and reflected in lower dietary intake of carbohydrate-rich staple foods, and fruits and vegetables. Breastfeeding was extended in the Maasai, despite higher reported consumption of cow's milk, a potential weaning food. Vaccination coverage was lowest in Maasai and Sukuma. Maasai who rely primarily on livestock herding showed signs of further disadvantage compared to Maasai relying primarily on agriculture. We discuss the potential ecological, socioeconomic, demographic and cultural factors responsible for these differences and the implications for population health research and policy."

However, there is limited knowledge from few countries of the durability of LLINs under user conditions. This study investigates LLIN durability in eight districts of Tanzania, selected for their demographic, geographic and ecological representativeness of the country as a whole. We use a two-stage approach: First, LLINs from recent national net campaigns will be evaluated retrospectively in 3,420 households. Those households will receive one of three leading LLIN products at random (Olyset(R), PermaNet(R)2.0 or Netprotect(R)) and will be followed up for three years in a prospective study to compare their performance under user conditions. LLIN durability will be evaluated by measuring Attrition (the rate at which nets are discarded by households), Bioefficacy (the insecticidal efficacy of the nets measured by knock-down and mortality of mosquitoes), Chemical content (g/kg of insecticide available in net fibres) and physical Degradation (size and location of holes). In addition, we will extend the current national mosquito insecticide Resistance monitoring program to additional districts and use these data sets to provide GIS maps for use in health surveillance and decision making by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). The data will be of importance to policy makers and vector control specialists both in Tanzania and the SSA region to inform best practice for the maintenance of high and cost-effective coverage and to maximise current health gains in malaria control."

Systematic comparisons of different measures have rarely been reported. This study evaluated the likely direction of bias observed when using open-ended, closed-ended, and perceived ease of comprehension measures among women administered a mock informed consent process in Mwanza, Tanzania. Participants were randomized to either a closed-ended or an open-ended assessment of comprehension, administered the consent process for a hypothetical HIV prevention trial in Kiswahili, and then administered a comprehension assessment, per their randomization. They were then asked how easy or hard it was to understand each of the informed consent components measured in the comprehension assessment. Women in the closed-ended arm had significantly higher overall comprehension scores than in the open-ended arm. Perceived scores were significantly higher when compared to both open-ended and close-ended scores within arms but were similar between arms. Findings highlight the importance of comprehension assessments in complex clinical trials that go beyond asking participants if they understand or have any questions. They also indicate the need for continued exploration of objective measures of comprehension in international clinical research settings, so that points in need of clarification can be efficiently and effectively identified and addressed. Such measures would reduce burdens on both staff and participants that result from well-intentioned but potentially unnecessary time spent explaining in unwarranted detail things already understood."

A case in point is Tanzania which has piloted a mobile phone-based Management Information System (MIS) for the control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) where village health workers (VHWs) were given mobile phones with web-based software to test the feasibility of using frontline health workers to capture data at point of source. Based on qualitative case study research carried out in 2011, we found that providing mobile phones to VHWs has helped to increase the efficiency of routine work boosting the motivation and self-esteem of VHWs. However, despite these advantages, the information generated from the mobile phone-based NTD MIS has yet to be used to support decentralised decision-making. Even with improved technology and political will, the biggest hindrance to local usage of information for health planning is the lack of synthesised and analysed health information from the district and national levels to the villages. Without inculcating a culture of providing health information feedback to frontline workers and community organisations, the benefits of the intervention will be limited. If not addressed, this will mean that mobiles have maintained the one-way upward flow of information for NTD control and simply made reporting more hi-tech."

Methods: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted at KDH, north-eastern Tanzania. Patients aged 2 to 59 months presenting at the outpatient department with an acute medical condition and fever (measured axillary temperature ?37.5°C) were enrolled. Blood samples were examined for malaria parasites, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and bacterial infections. A urine culture was performed in selected cases to test for bacterial infection and a chest radiograph was requested if pneumonia was suspected. Diagnosis was based on both clinical and laboratory investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Results:A total of 867 patients with a median age of 15.1 months (Interquartile range 8.6–29.9) were enrolled from January 2013 to October 2013. Respiratory tract infections were the leading clinical diagnosis with 406/867 (46.8%) of patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection and 130/867 (15.0%) with pneumonia. Gastroenteritis was diagnosed in 184/867 (21.2%) of patients. Malaria infection was confirmed in 72/867 (8.3%) of patients. Bacterial infection in blood and urine accounted for 26/808 (3.2%) infections in the former, and 66/373 (17.7%) infections in the latter. HIV infection was confirmed in 10/824 (1.2%) of patients. Respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis were frequent in patients under 36 months of age (87.3% and 91.3% respectively). Co-infections were seen in 221/867 (25.5%) of patients. The cause of fever was not identified in 65/867 (7.5%) of these patients.                    Conclusions: The different proportions of infections found among febrile children reflect the causes of fever in the study area.

Here the population genetics of An. gambiaes.s. and An. arabiensis in the central, eastern and island regions of Tanzania were compared. Microsatellite markers were screened in 33 collections of female An. gambiae s.l., originating from 22 geographical locations, four of which were sampled in two or three years between 2008 and 2010. An. gambiae were sampled from six sites, An. arabiensis from 14 sites, and both species from two sites, with an additional colonised insectary sample of each species.

An understanding of how patients make sense of these experiences is important to consider in planning and supporting the clinical management and treatment for co-infected individuals. A qualitative study was conducted in Tanzania alongside a clinical trial of concomitant treatment for HIV and malaria co-infection. Focus group discussions were held with people receiving treatment for HIV and/or malaria, and in-depth interviews with health workers responsible for HIV care and members of the clinical trial team. Data were analysed inductively to identify themes and develop theoretical narratives. Results suggest that people living with HIV perceived malaria to be more harmful to them due to their compromised immune status but saw the disease as unavoidable. For those enrolled in the clinical controlled study, taking anti-malarials together with ARVs was largely seen as unproblematic, with health workers' advice and endorsement of concomitant drug taking influential in reported adherence. However, perceptions of drug strength appeared to compel some people not enrolled in the clinical study to take the drugs at separate times to avoid anticipated harm to the body. Management of HIV and malaria concurrently often requires individuals to cross the domains of different disease programmes. In the context of a trial concerned with both diseases, patients experienced the support of clinicians in guiding and reassuring them about when and how to take drugs concomitantly. This points towards the need to continue to strive for integrated care for patients with HIV."

MethodsThe study was based on data from a 1-year study of the cause of illness in febrile paediatric admissions to a district hospital in north-east Tanzania. All villages in the catchment population were geolocated, and travel times were estimated from availability of local transport. Using bands of travel time to hospital, we compared admission rates, inpatient case fatality rates and child mortality rates in the catchment population using inpatient deaths as the numerator. ResultsThree thousand hundred and eleven children under the age of 5years were included of whom 4.6% died; 2307 were admitted from <3h away of whom 3.4% died and 804 were admitted from 3h away of whom 8.0% died. The admission rate declined from 125/1000 catchment population at <3h away to 25/1000 at 3h away, and the corresponding hospital deaths/catchment population were 4.3/1000 and 2.0/1000, respectively. Children admitted from more than 3h away were more likely to be male, had a longer pre-admission duration of illness and a shorter time between admission and death. Assuming uniform mortality in the catchment population, the predicted number of deaths not benefiting from hospital admission prior to death increased by 21.4% per hour of travel time to hospital. If the same admission and death rates that were found at <3h from the hospital applied to the whole catchment population and if hospital care conferred a 30% survival benefit compared to home care, then 10.3% of childhood deaths due to febrile illness in the catchment population would have been averted. ConclusionsThe mortality impact of poor access to hospital care in areas of high paediatric mortality is likely to be substantial although uncertainty over the mortality benefit of inpatient care is the largest constraint in making an accurate estimate. ObjectifInvestiguer l'association le cas echeant, entre la mortalite infantile et la distance a l'hopital le plus proche. MethodesL'etude a ete basee sur les donnees d'une etude de 1 an sur la cause de la maladie dans les admisions d'enfants febriles a l'hopital de district dans le nord-est de la Tanzanie. Tous les villages de la population d'etude ont ete geo-localises et les durees de transport ont ete estimees a partir de la disponibilite de transport local. En utilisant des intervalles de durees de voyage a l'hopital, nous avons compare les taux d'admission, de letalite des patients hospitalises et de mortalite infantile dans la population d'etude avec comme numerateur les deces de patients hospitalises. Resultats3111 enfants de moins de 5 ans ont ete inclus dont 4,6% sont decedes; 2307 ont ete admis en moins de 3 h de trajet dont 3,4% sont decedes et 804 ont ete admis a 3h de trajet dont 8,0% sont decedes. Le taux d'admission diminuait en passant de 125/1000 dans la populatiopn d'etude pour des trajets <3h a 25/1000 pour des trajets 3h et les taux de deces a l'hopital correspondant de la population d'etude etaient respectivement de 4,3/1000 et 2,0/1000. Les enfants admis pour un trajet 3h etaient plus susceptibles d'etre de sexe masculin, d'avoir une plus longue duree de la maladie avant l'admission et un temps plus court entre l'admission et le deces. En supposant une mortalite uniforme dans la population d'etude, le nombre attendu de deces ne beneficiant pas d'admisison d'hopital avant le deces augmentait de 21,4% par heure de duree de trajet a l'hopital. Si les memes taux d'admissions et de mortalite trouves pour les trajets a l'hopital <3h etaient appliques a l'ensemble de la population d'etude et si les soins hospitaliers conferaient un benefice de survie de 30% par rapport aux soins a domicile, alors 10,3% des deces d'enfants pour cause de maladie febrile dans la population d'etude auraient ete evites. ConclusionL'impact sur la mortalite de l'acces limite aux soins hospitaliers dans les zones avec une mortalite pediatrique elevee est probablement importante meme si l'incertitude sur le benefice de la prestation des soins hospitaliers sur la mortalite est le plus grand obstacle a estimer de facon precise. ObjetivoInvestigar la asociacion, si existe, entre la mortalidad infantil y la distancia hasta el hospital mas cercano. MetodosEl estudio se baso en datos de un estudio de 1 ano sobre la causa de enfermedad en pacientes pediatricos febriles admitidos en un hospital distrital del nordeste de Tanzania. Todos los poblados dentro del area de estudio estaban geolocalizados, y los tiempos de viaje se calcularon segun la disponibilidad del transporte local. Utilizando bandas del tiempo requerido para el traslado hasta el hospital, comparamos las tasas de admision, tasas de mortalidad de pacientes hospitalizados y tasas de mortalidad infantil entre la poblacion del area de estudio utilizando las muertes de pacientes ingresados como el numerador. ResultadosSe incluyeron 3,111 ninos menores de 5 anos de los cuales un 4.6% murio; 2307 fueron admitidos desde <3 horas de distancia, de los cuales un 3.4% murio y 804 fueron admitidos desde 3 horas de distancia y de estos murio un 8.0%. La tasa de admision cayo de 125/1,000 entre la poblacion de estudio a <3 h de distancia, a 25/1,000 a 3 horas de distancia, y las muertes hospitalarias /poblacion de estudio correspondientes eran 4.3/1,000 y 2.0/1,000 respectivamente. Los ninos admitidos, que vivian a mas de 3h, tenian una mayor probabilidad de ser hombres, tenian una enfermedad con una mayor duracion antes de ser admitidos y un menor periodo de duracion entre la admision y la muerte. Asumiendo una mortalidad uniforme en la poblacion de estudio, el numero vaticinado de muertes que no se benefician de la admision hospitalaria antes de la muerte aumento en 21.4% por hora de viaje hasta el hospital. Si las mismas tasas de admision y muerte que se encontraron a <3 h del hospital aplicasen a toda la poblacion de estudio, y si los cuidados hospitalarios conferian un 30% de beneficio de supervivencia en comparacion con los cuidados recubidos en el hogar, entonces se podrian haber evitado un 10.3% de las muertes infantiles debido a enfermedades febriles entre la poblacion de estudio. ConclusionesEl impacto sobre la mortalidad de un mal acceso a los cuidados hospitalarios en areas con una alta mortalidad pediatrica podria ser sustancial, aunque la incerteza del beneficio de los cuidados hospitalarios sobre la mortalidad es la principal limitacion para hacer una estimacion precisa."

The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of diarrhea among under-fives and assess knowledge on causes of diarrhea among adults in Mkuranga district Tanzania. Methods Interviews with heads of households and observations were the methods of data collection employed by this study. Results The prevalence of diarrhea in children below the age of five years as reported by heads of households was 6.1% and most affected were children in age groups 12 – 17 and 18 – 23 months (11.6% and 15.8% respectively; p – value 0.001). The rate of diarrhea incidence was 1 episode per 10 children per week. The mean duration of diarrhea illness was 1.7 days. Most under-fives had diarrhea for one (38.1%) or two (24%) days. Respondents in the 4th least poor quintile were more likely to have comprehensive knowledge on causes of diarrhea compared to respondents in the 1st poorest quintile. Male respondents were two times more likely to have comprehensive knowledge than female respondents. Respondents with comprehensive knowledge on causes of diarrhea were less likely to have poor hand-washing practice and more likely to have received water, hygiene and sanitation education. Under-fives in age group 12 – 17 months and those from households with reported poor hand washing practice were more likely to experience diarrhea episodes. Conclusion Although prevalence of diarrhea reported in this study is low, the one week incidence is moderately high but less severe. Majority of household respondents had inadequate knowledge on causes of diarrhea and poor hand-washing practice. There is a need to provide WASH education to improve their knowledge on causes of diarrhea and hand washing practice."

The objective of this study was to explore the perceived motives for women or females guardians to volunteer for their children to participate in biomedical research and to explore experiences and challenges faced by Community Owned Resource Persons (CORPs) when mobilizing community members to participate in biomedical research.                                                                                                         Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in Korogwe district, in north-eastern Tanzania. Qualitative methods combining random and purposive sampling techniques were used for data collection. A randomly selected sample using random table method from the existing list of households in the ward office was used to select participants for Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). A purposive sampling technique was used for In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with CORPs. Thematic framework analysis was used to analyze the data.                               Results: Need for better health services, availability of qualified clinicians, and better access to services provided at the research points were reported as main motives for communitymembers to participate in biomedical research. With regard to experience and challenges faced by CORPs, the main reasons for mothers and guardians not participating in biomedical research were linked to misconception of the malariometric surveys, negative perception of the validity and sensitivity of rapid diagnostic tests, fear of knowing Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection (HIV)/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) sero status, and lack of trust for the medical information provided by the CORPs. Challenges reported by CORPs included lack ofawareness of malariometric surveys among participants, time consumption in mobilization of the community, difficulties in identifying individual results, and family responsibilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Conclusion: This study has shown that majority of community members had positive perceptions of the about malariometric surveys services provided. The availability of free health services was the major determining factor for community members’ participation in malariometric surveys. CORPs are instrumental in mobilizing community members participation during malariometric surveys, despite their experiences and the challenges they face."

A number of Plasmodium falciparum mutations are known to be associated with resistance to SP, but it is not known if the prevalence of these mutations is increasing or decreasing under the conditions of reduced levels of SP use. This study reports on the current SP resistant quintuple Pfdhfr-Pfdhps mutations in six regions of Tanzania. Finger-prick blood on filter paper and rapid diagnostic test strips from P. falciparum-positive individuals of all age groups attending health facilities in six regions of Tanzania between June 2010 and August 2011 were obtained. Using chelex-100 extracted DNA, genotyping was done for mutations on codons 51, 59 and 108 of Pfdhfr and 437 and 540 of Pfdhps genes using PCR-RFLP technique. A total of 802 malaria-positive samples were screened and genotyped. The prevalence of Pfdhfr 51I, Pfdhps 437G and 540E varied between the regions (p?<?0.001) whereas Pfdhfr 59R (FE 10.79, p?=?0.225) and 108 N (FE 10.61, p?=?0.239) did not vary between the regions. The Pfdhfr triple mutant was above 84% and close to fixation levels in all regions, whereas the Pfdhps double mutation ranged from 43.8 to 97% between the regions. The quintuple mutant (IRNGE) was the most prevalent in all regions and it varied significantly from 37.5 to 90.2% (?2?=?1.11, p <0.001). There is evidence of persistent high levels of SP resistance markers in Tanzania with evidence of quintuple mutations that are likely to become fixed in the population. This threatens the future of SP not only in IPTp programmes, but as a combination drug for ACT. Continuous monitoring of SP-IPTp efficacy should be encouraged subsequent to searching for alternative drugs for IPTp in East Africa"

Permethrin resistance in An. arabiensis in Lower Moshi, Tanzania has been linked to elevated levels of both P450 monooxygenases and ?-esterases. We have conducted a gene expression study to identify specific genes linked with metabolic resistance in the Lower Moshi An. arabiensis population. Microarray experiments employing an An. gambiae whole genome expression chip were performed on An. arabiensis, using interwoven loop designs. Permethrin-exposed survivors were compared to three separate unexposed mosquitoes from the same or a nearby population. A subsection of detoxification genes were chosen for subsequent quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Microarray analysis revealed significant over expression of 87 probes and under expression of 85 probes (in pairwise comparisons between permethrin survivors and unexposed sympatric and allopatric samples from Dar es Salaam (controls). For qRT-PCR we targeted over expressed ABC transporter genes (ABC ‘2060’), a glutathione-S-transferase, P450s and esterases. Design of efficient, specific primers was successful for ABC ‘2060’and two P450s (CYP6P3, CYP6M2). For the CYP4G16 gene, we used the primers that were previously used in a microarray study of An. arabiensis from Zanzibar islands. Over expression of CYP4G16 and ABC ‘2060’ was detected though with contrasting patterns in pairwise comparisons between survivors and controls. CYP4G16 was only up regulated in survivors, whereas ABC ‘2060’ was similar in survivors and controls but over expressed in Lower Moshi samples compared to the Dar es Salaam samples. Increased transcription of CYP4G16 and ABC ‘2060’ are linked directly and indirectly respectively, with permethrin resistance in Lower Moshi An. arabiensis. Increased transcription of a P450 (CYP4G16) and an ABC transporter (ABC 2060) are linked directly and indirectly respectively, with permethrin resistance in Lower Moshi An. arabiensis. Our study provides replication of CYP4G16 as a candidate gene for pyrethroid resistance in An. arabiensis, although its role may not be in detoxification, and requires further investigation"

Pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles arabiensis has been reported in several countries of East and Central Africa. Four cross-sectional surveys of A. arabiensis in Lower Moshi were conducted in 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013 to determine levels of resistance to pyrethroids, organochlorines, organophosphates and carbamates using World Health Organization (WHO) standard diagnostic dosages. Mosquitoes were identified to species level and genotyped for both L1014F and L1014S mutations by hydrolysis probe assays. A. arabiensis remains the dominant malaria vector in the area. Full susceptibility to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), organophosphates and carbamates was recorded in all eight villages. Following the current WHO guidelines, resistance to permethrin and lambdacyhalothrin was observed in 2009 with mortality rates ranging from 80 to 90% and from 66 to 97% for lambdacyhalothrin. Reduced susceptibility to deltamethrin was observed (87 to 97% mortality). The percentage mortality to permethrin, deltamethrin, lambdacyhalothrin was less than 90% in 2013 in all villages except in one village where mortality rate for deltamethrin was found to be 99%. These results clearly demonstrate the presence of pyrethroid resistance in A. arabiensis in Lower Moshi. The L1014F resistant allele was detected in one mosquito out of 642 that were screened for kdr mutation (allele frequency of 0.08%). The lack of DDT resistance coupled with previous studies showing very low frequency kdr suggests that enzyme-based mechanisms are responsible for resistance in A. arabiensis. Further studies are needed to investigate operational impact of observed resistance on malaria vector control interventions in the area"

Based on this evidence, it has been hypothesised that the immunodeficiency effects of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection may affect the efficacy of praziquantel in co-infected human hosts. Thus, the present study assessed the efficacy of praziquantel by comparing parasitological cure rates and the reduction in infection intensity in HIV-1 seronegative individuals infected with S. mansoni and HIV-1 seropositive individuals co-infected with S. mansoni, following treatment with a single oral dose of praziquantel. This was a prospective longitudinal study which included, at baseline, 555 S. mansoni infected adults aged 21-55 years, who were either co-infected or not with HIV-1 and who lived in fishing villages along Lake Victoria in Northwest Tanzania. These individuals were treated with a single oral dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg) and, at 12 weeks, single stool samples were obtained and examined for S. mansoni eggs using the Kato-Katz technique. Finger prick and venous blood samples were collected for HIV-1 screening and CD4(+) cell quantification. The parasitological cure rate did not differ significantly from the HIV-1 serostatus (P = 0.12): among the co-infected individuals, the cure rate was 48.3% (14/29), and among the individuals infected only with S. mansoni, the cure rate was 62.6% (329/526). The egg reduction rate did not vary with the HIV-1 serostatus (P = 0.22): 77.22% for HIV-1 seronegative and 75% for HIV-1 seropositive individuals. The level of CD4(+) cell counts (median 228 cells/?L: range 202-380 cells) did not influence the cure rate (P = 0.23) or the reduction in the intensity of the infection (P = 0.37). The HIV-1 infection per se or its moderate immunodeficiency effects, demonstrated by the range of CD4(+) cell counts observed in co-infected individuals, did not affect praziquantel efficacy, as measured by the parasitological cure rate and the reduction in intensity of infection in the present study cohort."

However, few community-based studies have been conducted to assess the association between the two diseases. The present study examined whether the infection with HIV-1 is associated with an altered susceptibility to S. mansoni infection by comparing the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection among those infected and not infected with HIV-1. Any influence of HIV-1 associated immunodeficiency on the intensity of S. mansoni infection was also investigated. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,785 randomly selected adults (aged 21-55 years) in fishing villages of north-western Tanzania. Single stool samples were obtained and examined for S. mansoni eggs using the Kato Katz technique. Finger prick and venous blood samples were collected for HIV-1 screening and CD4(+) cell quantification. Demographic information was collected by questionnaire. Results: Of the 1,785 individuals from whom complete data were obtained, 854 (47.85%, 95% CI; 40.46 - 56.57) were infected with S. mansoni and had a mean intensity of 183.21(95% CI; 165.61-202.70) eggs per gram of faeces (epg). A total of 125 individuals (6.29%, 95% CI 3.59-11.04) were infected with HIV-1 and only 40% (n=50) of them were co-infected with S. mansoni. No differences in prevalence of S. mansoni infection or intensities of infection, as estimated by egg count (epg), were observed between HIV-1 sero-positive individuals and HIV-1 negative individuals. In generalized regression models (adjusted for sex, age, occupation, residence and level of education), being infected with HIV-1 did not increase the risk (APR=1.01, 95%; 0.83-1.21, P=0.93) or intensity (AOR = 0.84, 95% CI; 0.56-1.25, P = 0.33) of S. mansoni infection. Among individuals co-infected with HIV-1 and S. mansoni infection, the intensity of infection (epg) was not associated (P = 0.21) or correlated (P = 0.13) with CD4(+) cell counts. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that HIV-1 infection may not have a major effect on S. mansoni infection or on the excretion of eggs from the co-infected individuals. However, further studies are needed to understand the biological interaction between HIV-1 and S. mansoni in a large cohort of co-infected individuals."

Most survey respondents trusted in the safety (73.1%) and efficacy of larviciding, both with regards to mosquito control (92.3%) and to reduce malaria infection risk (91.9%). Probing these perceptions using a Likert scale provides a more detailed picture. Focus group participants and key informants were also receptive to larviciding, but stressed the importance of sensitization before its implementation. Overall, 73.4% of survey respondents expressed a willingness to make a nominal household contribution to a larviciding program, a proportion which decreased as the proposed contribution increased. The lower-bound mean willingness to pay is estimated at 2,934 Tanzanian Shillings (approximately US$1.76) per three month period. We present a multivariate probit regression analysis examining factors associated with willingness to pay.

CDs result in significant individual suffering, disrupting daily life, threatening livelihoods and causing one-third of the years lost to illness or death worldwide. This paper aims to analyse the current strategies in the control and prevention of CDs in sub-Saharan Africa and proposes an ecohealth approach in relation to current changing epidemiological profiles. Whilst in recent years the burden of HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have helped to mobilise large amounts of funding and expertise to help address them, many CDs, particularly those affecting the poor, have been neglected. People living in rural areas are also likely to be politically marginalised and living in degraded environments. They often lack assets, knowledge and opportunities to gain access to health care or protect themselves from infections. New diseases are also emerging at unprecedented rates and require attention. Many CDs are rooted in environmental and livelihood conditions and mediated by social and individual determinants. It is now increasingly recognised that a much broader, coordinated and multi-sectoral ecohealth approach is required to address CDs in sub-Saharan Africa. An ecohealth approach has been shown to be more robust in public health interventions than the traditional medical approach. The approach helps to generate an understanding of ecosystem factors that influence the emergence and spread of both old and new diseases, considers temporal and spatial dimensions of disease infection and allows systems thinking. In conclusion, establishing intersectoral and multisectoral linkages is important to facilitate joint efforts to address CDs at the national, district and community levels.

The primary endpoint was reached by 65 (8·5%) of 767 patients in the early ART group versus 71 (9·2%) of 771 in the delayed ART group (relative risk [RR] 0·91, 95% CI 0·64-1·30; p=0·9). Of patients with a CD4 cell count of 220-349 cells per ?L, 26 (7·9%) of 331 patients versus 33 (9·6%) of 342 reached the primary endpoint (RR 0·80, 95% CI 0·46-1·39; p=0·6). For those with 350 cells per ?L or more, 39 (8·9%) of 436 versus 38 (8·9%) of 429 reached the primary endpoint (RR 1·01, 95% CI 0·63-1·62; p=0·4). Mortality did not differ significantly between treatment groups (RR 1·4, 95% CI 0·8-2·3; p=0·23). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 149 (18%) of 834 patients assigned early ART versus 174 (21%) of 841 assigned delayed ART (p=0·37). 87 (10%) of 834 versus 84 (10%) of 841 had immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (p=0·56). ART can be delayed until after completion of 6 months of tuberculosis treatment for HIV-positive patients with tuberculosis who have CD4 cell counts greater than 220 cells per ?L.

This article describes the genetic profile of M tuberculosis across Tanzania and suggests how spoligotype families might affect drug resistance and treatment outcomes for smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients in Tanzania. We conducted the study from 2006 to 2008, and the isolates were obtained from samples collected under the routine drug resistance surveillance system. The isolates were from specimens collected from 2001 to 2007, and stored at the Central and Reference Tuberculosis Laboratory. A total of 487 isolates from 23 regions in the country were spoligotyped. We were able to retrieve clinical information for 446 isolates only. Out of the 487 isolates spoligotyped, 195(40.0%) belonged to the Central Asian (CAS) family, 84 (17.5%) to the Latin American Mediterranean (LAM) family, 49 (10.1%) to the East-African Indian (EAI) family, and 33 (6.8%) to the Beijing family. Other isolates included 1 (0.2%) for H37Rv, 10 (2.1%) for Haarlem, 4 (0.8%) for S family, 58 (11.9%) for T family and 52 (10.7%) for unclassified. No spoligotype patterns were consistent with M bovis. Regarding treatment outcomes, the cure rate was 80% with no significant variation among the spoligotype families. The overall level of MDR TB was 2.5% (3/12 1), with no significant difference among the spoligotype families. All Beijing strains (11.8%, 30/254) originated from the Eastern and Southern zones of the country, of which 80% were from Dar es Salaam. Isolates from the CAS and T families were reported disproportionately from the Eastern-Southern zone, and EAI and LAM families from the Northern-Lake zones but the difference was not statistically significant. Five isolates were identified as non-tuberculous Mycobacteria. In conclusion, M. tuberculosis isolates from pulmonary tuberculosis cases in Tanzania were classified mostly within the CAS, LAM, and EAI and T families, while the Beijing family comprised about 7% isolates only. Consistently good treatment outcomes were recorded across these spoligotype families. The proportion of drug resistance strains was low. The findings also suggest variation of spoligotype families with varying geographical localities within the country, and identify this area for further research to confirm this finding."

Hence, little is known about the diversity of Mycobacterium spp. in TB infections. Different genotypes or lineages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis vary in virulence and induce different inflammatory and immune responses. Trained Cricetomys rats show a potential for rapid diagnosis of TB. They detect over 28 % of smear-negative, culture-positive TB. However, it is unknown whether these rats can equally detect sputa from patients infected with different genotypes of M. tuberculosis. A 4-month prospective study on diversity of Mycobacterium spp. was conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. 252 sputa from 161 subjects were cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen medium and thereafter tested by rats. Mycobacterial isolates were subjected to molecular identification and multispacer sequence typing (MST) to determine species and genotypes. A total of 34 Mycobacterium spp. isolates consisting of 32 M. tuberculosis, 1 M. avium subsp. hominissuis and 1 M. intracellulare were obtained. MST analyses of 26 M. tuberculosis isolates yielded 10 distinct MST genotypes, including 3 new genotypes with two clusters of related patterns not grouped by geographic areas. Genotype MST-67, shared by one-third of M. tuberculosis isolates, was associated with the Mwananyamala clinic. This study shows that diverse M. tuberculosis genotypes (n = 10) occur in Dar es Salaam and trained rats detect 80 % of the genotypes. Sputa with two M. tuberculosis genotypes (20 %), M. avium hominissuis and M. intracellulare were not detected. Therefore, rats detect sputa with different M. tuberculosis genotypes and can be used to detect TB in resource-poor countries."

However, there are no validations of the Spectrum model against empirical serological and mortality data from populations in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods Serologic, demographic and verbal autopsy data have been regularly collected among over 30,000 residents in north-western Tanzania since 1994. Five-year age-specific mortality rates (ASMRs) per 1,000 person years and the probability of dying between 15 and 60 years of age (45Q15,) were calculated and compared with the Spectrum model outputs. Mortality trends by HIV status are shown for periods before the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (1994–1999, 2000–2005) and the first 5 years afterwards (2005–2009). Results Among 30–34 year olds of both sexes, observed ASMRs per 1,000 person years were 13.33 (95% CI: 10.75–16.52) in the period 1994–1999, 11.03 (95% CI: 8.84–13.77) in 2000–2004, and 6.22 (95% CI; 4.75–8.15) in 2005–2009. Among the same age group, the ASMRs estimated by the Spectrum model were 10.55, 11.13 and 8.15 for the periods 1994–1999, 2000–2004 and 2005–2009, respectively. The cohort data, for both sexes combined, showed that the 45Q15 declined from 39% (95% CI: 27–55%) in 1994 to 22% (95% CI: 17–29%) in 2009, whereas the Spectrum model predicted a decline from 43% in 1994 to 37% in 2009. Conclusion From 1994 to 2009, the observed decrease in ASMRs was steeper in younger age groups than that predicted by the Spectrum model, perhaps because the Spectrum model under-estimated the ASMRs in 30–34 year olds in 1994–99. However, the Spectrum model predicted a greater decrease in 45Q15 mortality than observed in the cohort, although the reasons for this over-esti"

The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine candidate, which has shown significant efficacy against clinical malaria in a large Phase 3 trial, targets the Plasmodium falciparum CS protein, but the ability of serum from vaccinated individuals to inhibit sporogony in mosquitoes has not been evaluated. Previously a double-blind, randomized trial of RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, as compared with rabies vaccine, in five- to 17-month old children in Tanzania was conducted. In this study, polyclonal human antibodies were purified from the pools of sera taken one month after the third vaccination. IgGs were purified from four pools of sera from 25 RTS,S/AS01 vaccinated children each, and two pools of sera from 25 children vaccinated with rabies vaccine each. The ability of antibodies to inhibit P. falciparum oocyst formation and/or sporogony in the mosquito host was evaluated by a standard membrane-feeding assay. The test antibodies were fed on day 0 (at the same time as the gametocyte feed), or on days 3 or 6 (serial-feed experiments). The oocyst and sporozoite counts were performed on days 8 and 16, respectively. In addition, two human anti-CS monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and a control mAb were also evaluated. Polyclonal anti-CS IgG preparations from RTS,S-vaccinated children tested at concentrations of 149-210 ELISA units (EU)/ml did not show significant inhibition in oocyst and sporozoite formation when the antibodies were fed with gametocytes at the same time, or later (serial-feed experiments). Similarly, anti-CS mAbs tested at 6,421 or 7,122 EU/ml did not show reduction in oocyst and sporozoite formation. This study does not support the concept that anti-CS antibodies induced by the RTS,S/AS01 vaccines in humans noticeably reduce malaria transmission by blocking P. falciparum sporozoite development or salivary gland invasion in mosquitoes when taken up during feeding. "

Identifying these hotspots of malaria transmission would permit targeting of interventions and a more rapid reduction in malaria burden across the whole community. This study set out to compare different statistical methods of hotspot detection (SaTScan, kernel smoothing, weighted local prevalence) using different indicators (PCR positivity, AMA-1 and MSP-1 antibodies) for prediction of infection the following year. Two full surveys of four villages in Mwanza, Tanzania were completed over consecutive years, 2010-2011. In both surveys, infection was assessed using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). In addition in 2010, serologic markers (AMA-1 and MSP-119 antibodies) of exposure were assessed. Baseline clustering of infection and serological markers were assessed using three geospatial methods: spatial scan statistics, kernel analysis and weighted local prevalence analysis. Methods were compared in their ability to predict infection in the second year of the study using random effects logistic regression models, and comparisons of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for each model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the effect of varying radius size for the kernel and weighted local prevalence methods and maximum population size for the spatial scan statistic. Guided by AUC values, the kernel method and spatial scan statistics appeared to be more predictive of infection in the following year. Hotspots of PCR-detected infection and seropositivity to AMA-1 were predictive of subsequent infection. For the kernel method, a 1 km window was optimal. Similarly, allowing hotspots to contain up to 50% of the population was a better predictor of infection in the second year using spatial scan statistics than smaller maximum population sizes. Clusters of AMA-1 seroprevalence or parasite prevalence that are predictive of infection a year later can be identified using geospatial models. Kernel smoothing using a 1 km window and spatial scan statistics both provided accurate prediction of future infection. (Less)"

HbF levels are strongly influenced by genetic variants at three major genetic loci, Xmn1-HBG2, HMIP-2, and BCL11A, but the effect of these loci on the hematological phenotype in SCD, has so far not been investigated. In a cohort of individuals with SCD in Tanzania (HbSS and HbS/?° thalassemia, n = 726, aged 5 or older), HbF levels were positively correlated with hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) indices, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and negatively with white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts (all P < 0.0001). We subsequently assessed the contribution of the three HbF modifier loci and detected diverse effects, including a reduction in anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis associated with certain HbF-promoting alleles. The presence of the 'T' allele at Xmn1-HBG2 led to a significant increase in hemoglobin (P = 9.8 × 10(-3) ) but no changes in cellular hemoglobin content. Xmn1-HBG2 'T' also has a weak effect decreasing WBC (P = 0.06) and platelet (P = 0.06) counts. The BCL11A variant (rs11886868-'C') increases hemoglobin (P = 2 × 10(-3) ) and one of the HBS1L-MYB variants decreases WBC values selectively (P = 2.3 × 10(-4) ). The distinct pattern of effects of each variant suggests that both, disease alleviation through increased HbF production, and 'pleiotropic' effects on blood cells, are involved, affecting a variety of pathways."

Yet, IPTp coverage rates across Africa are still low due to several demand and supply constraints. Many countries implement the IPTp-SP strategy at antenatal care (ANC) clinics. This paper reports from a study on the knowledge and experience of health workers (HWs) at ANC clinics regarding psychosocial, behavioural and health system barriers to IPTp-SP delivery and uptake in Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Methods: Data were collected through questionnaire-based interviews with 78 HWs at 28 ANC clinics supplemented with informal discussions with current and recent ANC users in Mkuranga and Mufindi districts. Qualitative data were analysed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Quantitative data derived from interviews with HWs were analysed using non-parametric statistical analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Results: The majority of interviewed HWs were aware of the IPTp-SP strategy’s existence and of the recommended one month spacing of administration of SP doses. Some HWs were unsure of that it is not recommended to administer IPTp-SP and ferrous/folic acid concurrently. Others were administering three doses of SP per client following instruction from a non-governmental agency while believing that this was in conflict with national guidelines. About half of HWs did not find it appropriate for the government to recommend private ANC providers to provide IPTp-SP free of charge since doing so forces private providers to recover the costs elsewhere. HWs noted that pregnant women often register at clinics late and some do not comply with the regularity of appointments for revisits, hence miss  IPTp and other ANC services. HWs also noted some amplified rumours among clients regarding health risks and treatment failures of SP used during pregnancy, and together with clients’ disappointment with waiting times and the sharing of cups at ANC clinics for SP, limit the uptake of IPTp-doses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Conclusion: HWs still question SP’s treatment advantages and are confused about policy ambiguity on the recommended number of IPTp-SP doses and other IPTp-SP related guidelines. IPTp-SP uptake is further constrained by pregnant women’s perceived health risks of taking SP and of poor service quality."

Results: Data indicated that IPTp doses administered to women were inadequate and partly inconsistent. HMIS registers lacked space for IPT records, forcing HWs to manipulate their record-keeping. The proportion/number of IPTp recipients in related to the supply of SP for free delivery, to women’s attendance behaviours, showed variation by quarter and year of reporting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Conclusion: It is impossible to achieve rational health service planning when the HMIS is weak. Whilst it is acknowledged that the HMIS is already overloaded, concerted measures are urgently needed to accommodate data on new interventions and other vertical programs if malaria programs are to achieve their goals."

Several initiatives have demonstrated gains in reducing maternal and child morbidities and mortalities, increased health budgets, training and recruitment of health workforce, health buildings, procurement and supply of essential medicines, equipment, and other materials, fostering private-public-partnership, enrolling girls in schools, safe motherhood among other reproductive health issues, devolution of decision making powers to lower governance structures, coupled with launching short-term and long term programs for tackling MCH problems.

This study assessed the factors and specific objectives that influence malaria control policy decisions, as a crucial first step towards developing an inclusive malaria decision analysis support tool (MDAST). Methods Country-specific stakeholder engagement activities using structured questionnaires were carried out in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. The survey respondents were drawn from a non-random purposeful sample of stakeholders, targeting individuals in ministries and non-governmental organizations whose policy decisions and actions are likely to have an impact on the status of malaria. Summary statistics across the three countries are presented in aggregate. Results Important findings aggregated across countries included a belief that donor preferences and agendas were exerting too much influence on malaria policies in the countries. Respondents on average also thought that some relevant objectives such as engaging members of parliament by the agency responsible for malaria control in a particular country were not being given enough consideration in malaria decision-making. Factors found to influence decisions regarding specific malaria control strategies included donor agendas, costs, effectiveness of interventions, health and environmental impacts, compliance and/acceptance, financial sustainability, and vector resistance to insecticides. Conclusion Malaria control decision-makers in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania take into account health and environmental impacts as well as cost implications of different intervention strategies. Further engagement of government legislators and other policy makers is needed in order to increase funding from domestic sources, reduce donor dependence, sustain interventions and consolidate current gains in malaria."

These conditions potentially support transmission of schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminths (STH), but knowledge on the occurrence, transmission and control of these infections in urban settings is limited. The present study assessed the status of urinary schistosomiasis and STH across two different-sized cities in Tanzania - Dar es Salaam and Tanga - after a decade of anthelminthic intervention. Primary school children were examined for parasite eggs in urine and stool. Questionnaires were administered to the children, and observations were made on the urban environments. The burden of urinary schistosomiasis and STH was found to be low in both cities (overall 1.2% in Dar es Salaam and 0.3% in Tanga for urinary schistosomiasis; overall<1% in Dar es Salaam and 1-2% in Tanga for each STH infection), and the identified cases showed no clear pattern of spatial distribution. The findings indicated that a marked decrease in prevalence of these infections had occurred in the two cities during recent years. The observed promising developments appeared to have been accomplished by implementation of drug based intervention programmes, in combination with environmental change (fewer snail habitats) and generally improved levels of hygiene. Continued efforts, including anthelminthic treatment and health education, are important to maintain these positive achievements."

In Tanzania, rubella vaccination is not included in the national immunization schedule and there is therefore no antenatal screening for this viral disease. So far, there are no reports on the sero-prevalence of rubella among pregnant women in Tanzania. As a result, this study was undertaken to establish the sero-positivity rate of rubella and rubella risk factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care clinics in Mwanza, Tanzania. From November 2012 to May 2013 a total of 350 pregnant women were enrolled and their serum samples collected and analyzed using the AXSYM anti-rubella virus IgG/IgM-MEIA test. Demographic and clinical data were collected using a standardized data collection tool. Data analysis was done using STATA version 12. Of 342 pregnant women tested for rubella antibodies, 317 (92.6%) were positive for anti-rubella IgG while only 1 (0.3%) was positive for IgM. Higher sero-positivity rates were found in the age group of 25-44 years. Furthermore, it was observed that with each year increase in age, the risk of contracting rubella increases by 12% (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.22, P = 0.019). Women involved in farming and business women were at a higher risk of contracting rubella infection compared to formally employed women (OR: 4.9, P = 0.011; OR 7.1, p = 0.003 respectively). In univariate analysis, the risk of contracting rubella virus infection was found to increase with gestational age with a statistical significance. Sero-positivity rates of rubella are high in Mwanza and are significantly associated with an increase in age and being a farmer or a business woman. Screening of rubella and immunization of women at risk are highly recommended in this area with a high non-immune rate against rubella virus."

The mod- el has five classes namely susceptible, exposed animal TB, and exposed human TB, infectious and recovery. The model assumed that there are two classes for infected individuals, those who ac- quired TB through animal and those who acquire TB from human. Qualitative results show that the model has the disease-free equilibrium and at least one endemic equilibrium that is locally asymptotically stable. The study includes numerical simulations as a way of supporting the ana- lytical results. Graphical results indicate that animal TB has major contribution on overall TB transmission and the TB transmission can be reduced by ensuring intervention to both Animal TB and Human TB. Furthermore the equations indicate that there is at least one endemic equilibrium which translates that t animal and human have the contribution on TB transmission. This shows that both animals and humans together with fast progressors have contribution on TB transmis- sions."

Population dynamics of mosquito vectors is associated with disease epidemics. In our study, we use daily temperature and rainfall as model inputs to simulate dynamics of mosquito vectors population in relation to disease epidemics.                                    Methods/Findings: Time-varying distributed delays (TVDD) and multi-way functional response equations were implemented to simulate mosquito vectors and hosts developmental stages and to establish interactions between stages and phases of mosquito vectors in relation to vertebrate hosts for infection introduction in compartmental phases. An open-source modelling platforms, Universal Simulator and Qt integrated development environment were used to develop models in C++ programming language. Developed models include source codes for mosquito fecundity, host fecundity, water level, mosquito infection, host infection, interactions, and egg time. Extensible Markup Language (XML) files were used as recipes to integrate source codes in Qt creator with Universal Simulator plug-in. We observed that Floodwater Aedines and Culicine population continued to fluctuate with temperature and water level over simulation period while controlled by availability of host for blood feeding. Infection in the system was introduced by floodwater Aedines. Culicines pick infection from infected host once to amplify disease epidemic.

The use of wall hangings made from netting on interior walls for aesthetic purposes is a common practice in rural communities. Insecticide-treated net wall hangings can be produced in a long-lasting format and used in an approach that simulates indoor residual spraying (IRS). The efficacy of net wall hangings (NWH) treated with the residual organophosphate insecticide, pirimiphos methyl (1?g/sq m), was evaluated in experimental huts against malaria vectors in Muheza, Tanzania. To determine the optimum level of wall coverage required, NWH were tested on ceiling only, two walls, four walls, or four walls plus ceiling. Comparison was made with deltamethrin-treated NWH on two walls. Pirimiphos methyl (p-methyl)-treated NWH (on two walls) killed significantly higher proportions of anophelines (92% of Anopheles gambiae and 79% of Anopheles funestus) than the deltamethrin-treated NWH (15% of An. gambiae and 17% of An. funestus) (P?<?0.001). WHO susceptibility tests showed that the local vector population was susceptible to the organophosphates but resistant to pyrethroids. Mortality rates were significantly higher in huts with p-methyl NWH on two walls (92% for An. gambiae and 79% for An. funestus) than on ceiling only (61% for An. gambiae and 62% for An. funestus, P?<?0.05). There was no improvement in mortality when wall coverage with p-methyl NWH increased beyond two walls. Blood-feeding rates with p-methyl NWH were generally high across all the treatments (52-77%) and did not differ significantly from the control (64-67%). There was no evidence of reduced blood-feeding or increased exiting with increase in wall coverage with p-methyl NWH. Net wall hangings are an effective means of delivering insecticides in the domestic environment against malaria vectors. They could be more practical and acceptable than IRS thus showing enormous potential for malaria vector control. Appropriate binding or incorporation technology needs to be developed to enable the production of p-methyl NWH with residual activity lasting over a number of years. "

Malaria Journal 13: 28.", Insecticide resistance mechanisms associated with different environments in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae: a case study in Tanzania,malaria, Malaria Journal,2014,13,,28,,8,,,,,,,,,"Resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides is a growing concern in Africa. Since only a few insecticides are used for public health and limited development of new molecules is expected in the next decade, maintaining the efficacy of control programmes mostly relies on resistance management strategies. Developing such strategies requires a deep understanding of factors influencing resistance together with characterizing the mechanisms involved. Among factors likely to influence insecticide resistance in mosquitoes, agriculture and urbanization have been implicated but rarely studied in detail. The present study aimed at comparing insecticide resistance levels and associated mechanisms across multiple Anopheles gambiae sensu lato populations from different environments. Nine populations were sampled in three areas of Tanzania showing contrasting agriculture activity, urbanization and usage of insecticides for vector control. Insecticide resistance levels were measured in larvae and adults through bioassays with deltamethrin, DDT and bendiocarb. The distribution of An. gambiae sub-species and pyrethroid target-site mutations (kdr) were investigated using molecular assays. A microarray approach was used for identifying transcription level variations associated to different environments and insecticide resistance. Elevated resistance levels to deltamethrin and DDT were identified in agriculture and urban areas as compared to the susceptible strain Kisumu. A significant correlation was found between adult deltamethrin resistance and agriculture activity. The subspecies Anopheles arabiensis was predominant with only few An. gambiae sensu stricto identified in the urban area of Dar es Salaam. The L1014S kdr mutation was detected at elevated frequency in An gambiae s.s. in the urban area but remains sporadic in An. arabiensis specimens. Microarrays identified 416 transcripts differentially expressed in any area versus the susceptible reference strain and supported the impact of agriculture on resistance mechanisms with multiple genes encoding pesticide targets, detoxification enzymes and proteins linked to neurotransmitter activity affected. In contrast, resistance mechanisms found in the urban area appeared more specific and more related to the use of insecticides for vector control. Overall, this study confirmed the role of the environment in shaping insecticide resistance in mosquitoes with a major impact of agriculture activities. Results are discussed in relation to resistance mechanisms and the optimization of resistance management strategies."

Their subsequent tolerances were measured to deltamethrin (pyrethroid), DDT (organochlorine) and bendiocarb (carbamate) currently used for vector control. The mean LC50 was determined and tolerance ratios for larvae exposed to agrochemical comparatively with unexposed larvae were calculated and expressed as fold increased tolerance. Bioassays revealed a significant increase in larval tolerance to detamethrin (1.83-2.86 fold), DDT (1.31-1.53 fold) and bendiocarb (1.14-1.19 fold) following exposure to 0.1 µM and 1µM agrochemical mixture. The observed increased tolerance in this study is likely to be based on metabolic resistance mechanisms. Overall, this study reveals the potential of agrochemicals to increase the tolerance of mosquito larvae to chemical insecticides. "

Although pesticides used in agriculture have been frequently mentioned as an additional force driving the selection of resistance, only a few studies were dedicated to validate this hypothesis and characterise the underlying mechanisms. While insecticide resistance is rising dramatically in Africa, deciphering how agriculture affects resistance is crucial for improving resistance management strategies. In this context, the multigenerational effect of agricultural pollutants on the selection of insecticide resistance was examined in Anopheles gambiae. An urban Tanzanian An. gambiae population displaying a low resistance level was used as a parental strain for a selection experiment across 20 generations. At each generation larvae were selected with a mixture containing pesticides and herbicides classically used in agriculture in Africa. The resistance levels of adults to deltamethrin, DDT and bendiocarb were compared between the selected and non-selected strains across the selection process together with the frequency of kdr mutations. A microarray approach was used for pinpointing transcription level variations selected by the agricultural pesticide mixture at the adult stage. A gradual increase of adult resistance to all insecticides was observed across the selection process. The frequency of the L1014S kdr mutation rose from 1.6% to 12.5% after 20 generations of selection. Microarray analysis identified 90 transcripts over-transcribed in the selected strain as compared to the parental and the non-selected strains. Genes encoding cuticle proteins, detoxification enzymes, proteins linked to neurotransmitter activity and transcription regulators were mainly affected. RT-qPCR transcription profiling of candidate genes across multiple generations supported their link with insecticide resistance. This study confirms the potency of agriculture in selecting for insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. We demonstrated that the recurrent exposure of larvae to agricultural pollutants can select for resistance mechanisms to vector control insecticides at the adult stage. Our data suggest that in addition to selected target-site resistance mutations, agricultural pollutants may also favor cuticle, metabolic and synaptic transmission-based resistance mechanisms. These results emphasize the need for integrated resistance management strategies taking into account agriculture activities. "

Consequently, little attention is given to the fight against HIV and AIDS in this group. The present study investigated the magnitude of HIV and AIDS infection among older people in rural and urban areas of the Tanzania mainland. Subjects and methods The study was conducted in Mufindi and Babati districts of Iringa and Manyara regions, respectively, through multistage sampling procedures. Dried blood spot cards were used to collect blood samples for HIV testing among consenting participants. HIV testing was done and retested using different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Results A total of 720 individuals, 340 (47.2%) males and 380 (52.8%) females, were randomly selected, of whom 714 (99.2%) consented to HIV testing while six (0.8%) refused to donate blood. The age ranged from 50 to 98 years, with a mean age of 64.2 years. Overall, a total of 56 (7.8%) participants were HIV-positive. Females had a higher prevalence (8.3%) than males (7.4%), with Mufindi district recording the higher rate (11.3%) compared to the 3.7% of Babati district. The prevalence was higher in the rural population (9.4%) compared to 6.4% of their urban counterparts. Conclusion Although HIV/AIDS is considered a disease of individuals aged 15–49 years, the overall prevalence among the older people aged 50 years and above for Mufindi and Babati districts was higher than the national prevalence in the general population. These findings point to the need to consider strengthening interventions targeting older populations against HIV/AIDS in these districts while establishing evidence countrywide to inform policy decisions."

Here, we present inter- and intraspecies analysis of genome-wide RADseq data, in three Anopheles gambiae s.l. species collected from East Africa. The mosquitoes fall into three genotypic clusters representing described species (A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, and A. merus) with no evidence of cryptic breeding units. Anopheles merus is the most divergent of the three species, supporting a recent new phylogeny based on chromosomal inversions. Even though the species clusters are well separated, there is extensive shared polymorphism, particularly between A. gambiae and A. arabiensis. Divergence between A. gambiae and A. arabiensis does not vary across the autosomes but is higher in X-linked inversions than elsewhere on X or on the autosomes, consistent with the suggestion that this inversion (or a gene within it) is important in reproductive isolation between the species. The 2La/2L+a inversion shows no more evidence of introgression between A. gambiae and A. arabiensis than the rest of the autosomes. Population differentiation within A. gambiae and A. arabiensis is weak over approximately 190–270 km, implying no strong barriers to dispersal. Analysis of Tajima’s D and the allele frequency spectrum is consistent with modest population increases in A. arabiensis and A. merus, but a more complex demographic history of expansion followed by contraction in A. gambiae. Although they are less than 200 km apart, the two A. gambiae populations show evidence of different demographic histories."

Few data exist for the preparedness of African health facilities to handle the growing epidemic of chronic, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). We assessed the burden of NCDs in health facilities in northwestern Tanzania and investigated the strengths of the health system and areas for improvement with regard to primary care management of selected NCDs.                                                                                                                             METHODS: Between November, 2012, and May, 2013, we undertook a cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of 24 public and not-for profit health facilities in urban and rural Tanzania (four hospitals, eight health centres, and 12 dispensaries). We did structured interviews of facility managers, inspected resources, and administered self-completed questionnaires to 335 health-care workers. We focused on hypertension, diabetes, and HIV (for comparison). Our key study outcomes related to service provision, availability of guidelines and supplies, management and training systems, and preparedness of human resources.                                                                                                                                                    FINDINGS: Of adult outpatient visits to hospitals, 58% were for chronic diseases compared with 20% at health centres, and 13% at dispensaries. In many facilities, guidelines, diagnostic equipment, and fi rst-line drug therapy for the primary care of NCDs were inadequate, and management, training, and reporting systems were weak. Services for HIV accounted for most chronic disease visits and seemed stronger than did services for NCDs. Ten (42%) facilities had guidelines for HIV whereas three (13%) facilities did for NCDs. 261 (78%) health workers showed fair knowledge of HIV, whereas 198 (59%) did for hypertension and 187 (56%) did for diabetes. Generally, health systems were weaker in lower-level facilities. Front-line health-care workers (such as non-medical-doctor clinicians and nurses) did not have knowledge and experience of NCDs. For example, only 74 (49%) of 150 nurses had at least fair knowledge of diabetes care compared with 85 (57%) of 150 for hypertension and 119 (79%) of 150 for HIV, and only 31 (21%) of 150 had seen more than fi ve patients with diabetes in the past 3 months compared with 50 (33%) of 150 for hypertension and 111 (74%) of 150 for HIV.                                                                                                                                                                INTERPRETATION: Most outpatient services for NCDs in Tanzania are provided at hospitals, despite present policies stating that health centres and dispensaries should provide such services. We identifi ed crucial weaknesses (and strengths) in health systems that should be considered to improve primary care for NCDs in Africa and identified ways that HIV programmes could serve as a model and structural platform for these improvements"

Methods/Findings: A prospective cohort of 108 women and their infants in rural/semi-rural Tanzania were followed from delivery through six months. Cryptosporidium infection was determined in feces using modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Breastfeeding/infant feeding practices were queried and anthropometry measured. Maternal Cryptosporidium infection remained high throughout the study (monthly proportion?=?44 to 63%). Infection did not differ during lactation or by HIV-serostatus, except that a greater proportion of HIV-positive mothers were infected at Month 1. Infant Cryptosporidium infection remained undetected until Month 2 and uncommon through Month 3 however, by Month 6, 33% of infants were infected. There were no differences in infant infection by HIV-exposure. Overall, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) was limited, but as the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed declined from 32% at Month 1 to 4% at Month 6, infant infection increased from 0% at Month 1 to 33% at Month 6. Maternal Cryptosporidium infection was associated with increased odds of infant infection (unadjusted OR?=?3.18, 95% CI 1.01 to 9.99), while maternal hand washing prior to infant feeding was counterintuitively also associated with increased odds of infant infection (adjusted OR?=?5.02, 95% CI?=?1.11 to 22.78).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Conclusions: Both mothers and infants living in this setting suffer a high burden of Cryptosporidium infection, and the timing of first infant infection coincides with changes in breastfeeding practices. It is unknown whether this is due to breastfeeding practices reducing pathogen exposure through avoidance of contaminated food/water consumption; and/or breast milk providing important protective immune factors. Without a Cryptosporidium vaccine, and facing considerable diagnostic challenges and ineffective treatment in young infants, minimizing the overall environmental burden (e.g. contaminated water) and particularly, maternal Cryptosporidium infection burden as a means to protect against early infant infection needs prioritization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Author Summary: Early infancy and childhood Cryptosporidium infection is associated with poor nutritional status, stunted growth, and cognitive deficits, yet minimal research is available regarding the burden and risk factors worldwide. Since there is no vaccine available, and because diagnostic challenges exist and treatment for children younger than one year is ineffective, prevention of early infancy infection through a better understanding of basic epidemiology is critical. This study was designed to investigate symptomatic and clinically silent infection amongst HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative mothers and their infants in a longitudinal cohort, and to indentify potential risk factors. Findings indicate that infants are living in a Cryptosporidium environment as demonstrated by the chronically high level of maternal infection throughout the 6-month post-partum period. Despite this, infant infection prevalence remains low until six months of age when it dramatically rises. The increase in infant infection corresponds to a reduction in exclusive breastfeeding. As expected, maternal infection is associated with increased infant infection, but unexpectedly, so is maternal hand washing prior to infant feeding. Since prevention may indeed be the “best medicine” for infants, investigation of beneficial breastfeeding practices, protective correlates in breast milk, and ways to reduce the maternal and environmental Cryptosporidium burden are needed."

RSM with five level three-factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) was employed to determine optimal combination of independent factors- soaking time, extraction temperature and solid-solvent ratio. Both single and multiple factor experiments were conducted. In single factor experiment (SFE) each independent factor was assessed to give experimental range. Ferrous was estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometric method (AAS) while L-ascorbic acid was measured by iodometric titration technique. Data were analyzed using SPSS Version 16.0 and Design-Expert software Version 8.0.7.1. Mean and standard deviation of triplicates were calculated and assessed. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed to find differences between the effect of the factors and their interaction. Significance was considered at 5% level of confidence (i.e. P<0.05). Finally, the obtained data was fitted using a cubic order polynomial model. The optimized extraction parameters were determined at soaking time 48 minutes, solid-solvent ratio 44% and extraction temperature 55°C. Under these extraction conditions, amount of L-ascorbic acid and ferrous extracted were 83.1 and 7.8 mg/100g respectively. The RSM helped to study interaction effect of extraction temperature, soaking time and solid-solvent ratio.

We assessed the accuracy of a novel immunodiagnostic T-cell activation marker–tuberculosis (TAM-TB) assay in a proof-of-concept study to identify children with active tuberculosis. Methods Children with symptoms that suggested tuberculosis were prospectively recruited at the NIMR-Mbeya Medical Research Center in Mbeya, and the Ifakara Health Institute in Bagamoyo, Tanzania, between May 10, 2011, and Sept 4, 2012. Sputum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained for Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture and performance assessment of the TAM-TB assay. The children were assigned to standardised clinical case classifications based on microbiological and clinical findings. Findings Among 290 children screened, we selected a subgroup of 130 to ensure testing of at least 20 with culture-confirmed tuberculosis. 17 of 130 children were excluded because of inconclusive TAM-TB assay results. The TAM-TB assay enabled detection of 15 of 18 culture-confirmed cases (sensitivity 83·3%, 95% CI 58·6–96·4). Specificity was 96·8% (95% CI 89·0–99·6) in the cases that were classified as not tuberculosis (n=63), with little effect from latent tuberculosis infection. The TAM-TB assay identified five additional patients with highly probable or probable tuberculosis, in whom M tuberculosis was not isolated. The median time to diagnosis was 19·5 days (IQR 14-45) for culture. Interpretation The sputum-independent TAM-TB assay is a rapid and accurate blood test that has the potential to improve the diagnosis of active tuberculosis in children.

Its impact is well described in clinical cohort studies, but population-based evidence is rare. We use data from seven demographic surveillance sites that also conduct community-based HIV testing and collect information on the uptake of HIV services. We present crude death rates of adults (aged 15-64) for the period 2000-2011 by sex, HIV status, and treatment status. Parametric survival models are used to estimate age-adjusted trends in the mortality rates of people living with HIV (PLHIV) before and after the introduction of ART. The pooled ALPHA Network dataset contains 2.4 million person-years of follow-up time, and 39114 deaths (6893 to PLHIV). The mortality rates of PLHIV have been relatively static before the availability of ART. Mortality declined rapidly thereafter, with typical declines between 10 and 20% per annum. Compared with the pre-ART era, the total decline in mortality rates of PLHIV exceeds 58% in all study sites with available data, and amounts to 84% for women in Masaka (Uganda). Mortality declines have been larger for women than for men; a result that is statistically significant in five sites. Apart from the early phase of treatment scale up, when the mortality of PLHIV on ART was often very high, mortality declines have been observed in PLHIV both on and off ART. The expansion of treatment has had a large and pervasive effect on adult mortality. Mortality declines have been more pronounced for women, a factor that is often attributed to women's greater engagement with HIV services. Improvements in the timing of ART initiation have contributed to mortality reductions in PLHIV on ART, but also among those who have not (yet) started treatment because they are increasingly selected for early stage disease."

Antimicrobial bioassay was carried out at Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of Dar-es-Salaam between March 2013 and June 2013.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Methodology: Disk diffusion test was used to determine antimicrobial activity of the plant extracts. Chemical tests were used to determine the group of phytochemicals present in the sample extracts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Results: Sensitivity testing results indicated that S.aureus was found to be more sensitive than E. coli. Carissa spinarum L. methanolic extracts were the most active constituents and demonstrated the zone of inhibition values of 11.66±0.42 mm and 13.33±1.53 mm in diameter against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. The highest percentage values of relative inhibition zone diameter of 57.24% (E. coli) and 70.17% (S. aureus) were demonstrated by C. spinarum L. root methanolic extracts. In contrast, C. spinarum L. bark extracts did not show any antibacterial activity against the two bacterial species. Plant extracts demonstrated the minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 312 to 5000 ?g/ml. Phytochemical screening of crude extracts revealed the presence of saponins, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and sterols. The presence of these phytochemicals in the extracts was linked with observed antibacterial activity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Conclusion: This study has revealed that the antibacterial activity of different extracts of C. spinarum L. was attributed to the presence of several phytochemicals. The study findings suggest likelihood of designing and developing potentially active antibacterial agents from C. spinarum L."

Due to methodological limitations, earlier efforts to assess the linkage have lead to inconclusive results. The malaria transmission intensity and mortality burden across Africa (MTIMBA) project initiated by the INDEPTH Network collected longitudinally entomological data within a number of sites in sub-Saharan Africa to study this relationship. This work linked the MTIMBA entomology database with the routinely collected vital events within the Rufiji Demographic Surveillance System to analyse the transmission-mortality relation in the region.                                                                     METHODS:Bayesian Bernoulli spatio-temporal Cox proportional hazards models with village clustering, adjusted for age and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), were fitted to assess the relation between mortality and malaria transmission measured by entomology inoculation rate (EIR). EIR was predicted at household locations using transmission models and it was incorporated in the model as a covariate with measure of uncertainty. Effects of covariates estimated by the model are reported as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% Bayesian confidence interval (BCI) and spatial and temporal parameters are presented.                                                                                                                                                                                                            RESULTS: Separate analysis was carried out for neonates, infants and children 1-4 years of age. No significant relation between all-cause mortality and intensity of malaria transmission was indicated at any age in childhood. However, a strong age effect was shown. Comparing effects of ITN and EIR on mortality at different age categories, a decrease in protective efficacy of ITN was observed (i.e. neonates: HR = 0.65; 95% BCI:0.39-1.05; infants: HR = 0.72; 95% BCI:0.48-1.07; children 1-4 years: HR = 0.88; 95% BCI:0.62-1.23) and reduction on the effect of malaria transmission exposure was detected (i.e. neonates: HR = 1.15; 95% BCI:0.95-1.36; infants: HR = 1.13; 95% BCI:0.98-1.25; children 1-4 years: HR = 1.04; 95% BCI:0.89-1.18). A very strong spatial correlation was also observed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           CONCLUSION:These results imply that assessing the malaria transmission-mortality relation involves more than the knowledge on the performance of interventions and control measures. This relation depends on the levels of malaria endemicity and transmission intensity, which varies significantly between different settings. Thus, sub-regions analyses are necessary to validate and assess reproducibility of findings."

Understanding heterogeneity of malaria transmission has been difficult due to a lack of appropriate data. A comprehensive entomological database compiled by the Malaria Transmission Intensity and Mortality Burden across Africa (MTIMBA) project (2001-2004) at several sites is the most suitable dataset for studying malaria transmission-mortality relations. The data are sparse and large, with small-scale spatial-temporal variation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                OBJECTIVE: This work demonstrates a rigorous approach for analysing large and highly variable entomological data for the study of malaria transmission heterogeneity, measured by EIR, within the Rufiji Demographic Surveillance System (DSS), MTIMBA project site in Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                           DESIGN: Bayesian geostatistical binomial and negative binomial models with zero inflation were fitted for sporozoite rates (SRs) and mosquito density, respectively. The spatial process was approximated from a subset of locations. The models were adjusted for environmental effects, seasonality and temporal correlations and assessed based on their predictive ability. EIR was calculated using model-based predictions of SR and density.  RESULTS: Malaria transmission was mostly influenced by rain and temperature, which significantly reduces the probability of observing zero mosquitoes. High transmission was observed at the onset of heavy rains. Transmission intensity reduced significantly during Year 2 and 3, contrary to the Year 1, pronouncing high seasonality and spatial variability. The southern part of the DSS showed high transmission throughout the years. A spatial shift of transmission intensity was observed where an increase in households with very low transmission intensity and significant reduction of locations with high transmission were observed over time. Over 68 and 85% of the locations selected for validation for SR and density, respectively, were correctly predicted within 95% credible interval indicating good performance of the models.                              CONCLUSION: Methodology introduced here has the potential for efficient assessment of the contribution of malaria transmission in mortality and monitoring performance of control and intervention strategies."

Results: A total of 297 women (mean age=29±6.8 years) were involved. Seventy percent of the women had attained primary school education. About a quarter of women had two children of <5 years while over 58% had ?3 children. Most (71.4%) women had medium general knowledge on malaria while only eight percent of them had good knowledge on malaria in pregnancy. A significant proportion of women were not aware of the reasons for taking SP during pregnancy (35%), timing for SP (18%), and the effect of malaria on pregnancy (45.8%). Timing for first dose of SP for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) was 1-3 months (28.4%) and 4-6 months (36.8%). Some 78.1% were provided with SP under supervision of the health provider. Knowledge on malaria in pregnancy had a significant association with levels of education (p=0.024). Ninety-eight percent had an ITN, mostly (87.1%) received free from the government. All women attended the ANC during their last pregnancy. The coverage of IPT1 was 53.5% and IPTp2 was 41.1%. The proportion of women making more ANC visits decreased with increasing parity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Conclusion: This study showed that the knowledge of the pregnant women on malaria in pregnancy and IPTp was average and is likely to have an impact on the low IPTp coverage. Campaigns that provide educational massages on the risk of malaria during pregnancy and the usefulness of IPTp need to be emphasised."

Previously, MICE was successfully tested on strongly linked genetic data. We have now tested it on data of the HBA2 gene which, by the experimental design used in a malaria association study in Tanzania, shows a high missing data percentage and is weakly linked with the remaining genetic markers in the data set. We constructed different imputation models and studied their performance under different missing data conditions. Overall, MICE failed to accurately predict the true genotypes. However, using the best imputation model for the data, we obtained unbiased estimates for the genetic effects, and association signals of the HBA2 gene on malaria positivity. When the whole data set was analyzed with the same imputation model, the association signal increased from 0.80 to 2.70 before and after imputation, respectively. Conversely, postimputation estimates for the genetic effects remained the same in relation to the complete case analysis but showed increased precision. We argue that these postimputation estimates are reasonably unbiased, as a result of a good study design based on matching key socio?environmental factors."

Although ACT is still efficacious for treatment of uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin resistance has been reported in South East Asia suggesting that surveillance needs to be intensified by all malaria endemic countries. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Muheza district of north-eastern Tanzania, an area where the transmission has significantly declined in recent years. Eighty eight children (aged 6 months to 10 years) with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were recruited into the study. The patients were treated with standard doses of AL and followed up for 28 days. The primary end point was parasitological cure on day 28 while the secondary end points included: improvement in haemoglobin levels and occurrence, and severity of adverse events. A total of 163 febrile patients were screened, out of which 88 patients (56 under-fives and 32 aged ?5 years) were enrolled and 79 (89.8%) completed the 28 days of follow-up. There were no cases of early treatment failure whilst 40 (78.4%) under-fives and 21(75.0%) older children had adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) before PCR correction. Late clinical failure was seen in 5.6% (n?=?51) and 3.6% (n?=?28) of the under-fives and older children respectively; while 15.7% and 21.6% had late parasitological failure in the two groups respectively. After PCR correction, ACPR was 100% in both groups. Reported adverse events included cough (49.7%), fever (20.2%), abdominal pain (10.1%), diarrhoea (1.3%), headache (1.3%) and skin rashes (1.3%). This study showed that AL was safe, well-tolerated and efficacious for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Since Muheza has historically been a hotspot of drug resistance (e.g. pyrimethamine, chloroquine, and SP), surveillance needs to be continued to detect future changes in parasite sensitivity to ACT. "

Scientific evidence produced over time leads to change in clinical guidelines, and a serious challenge may emerge in the process of communicating the changes to healthcare practitioners and getting new practices adopted. There is very little information on the major barriers to implementing clinical guidelines in low-income settings. Looking at how continual updates to clinical guidelines within a particular health intervention are communicated may shed light on the processes at work. The aim of this paper is to explore how the content of a series of diverging infant feeding guidelines have been communicated to managers in the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV Programme (PMTCT) with the aim of generating knowledge about both barriers and facilitating factors in the dissemination of new and updated knowledge in clinical guidelines in the context of weak healthcare systems.                                       METHODS: A total of 22 in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted in 2011. All informants were linked to the PMTCT programme in Tanzania. The informants included managers at regional and district levels and health workers at health facility level.                                                                                                                                                              RESULTS: The informants demonstrated partial and incomplete knowledge about the recommendations. There was lack of scientific reasoning behind various infant feeding recommendations. The greatest challenges to the successful communication of the infant feeding guidelines were related to slowness of communication, inaccessible jargon-ridden English language in the manuals, lack of summaries, lack of supportive supervision to make the guidelines comprehensible, and the absence of a reading culture.                                   CONCLUSION:  The study encountered substantial gaps in knowledge about the diverse HIV and infant feeding policies. These gaps were partly related to the challenges of communicating the clinical guidelines. There is a need for caution in assuming that important changes in guidelines for clinical practice can easily be translated to and implemented in local programme settings, not least in the context of weak healthcare systems"

Since then, the current project has monitored the effect in communities and schools in rural areas of Tanga District. In 2013, after 8 rounds of MDA, spot check surveys were added in the other 7 districts of Tanga Region, to assess the regional LF status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Methods: LF vector and transmission surveillance, and human cross sectional surveys in communities and schools, continued in Tanga District as previously reported. In each of the other 7 districts, 2–3 spot check sites were selected and about 200 schoolchildren were examined for circulating filarial antigens (CFA). At 1–2 of the sites in each district, additional about 200 community volunteers were examined for CFA and chronic LF disease, and the CFA positives were re-examined for microfilariae (mf).                                                                     Results: The downward trend in LF transmission and human infection previously reported for Tanga District continued, with prevalences after MDA 8 reaching 15.5% and 3.5% for CFA and mf in communities (decrease by 75.5% and 89.6% from baseline) and 2.3% for CFA in schoolchildren (decrease by 90.9% from baseline). Surprisingly, the prevalence of chronic LF morbidity after MDA 8 was less than half of baseline records. No infective vector mosquitoes were detected after MDA 7. Spot checks in the other districts after MDA 8 showed relatively high LF burdens in the coastal districts. LF burdens gradually decreased when moving to districts further inland and with higher altitudes.                                                                    Conclusion: LF was still widespread in many parts of Tanga Region after MDA 8, in particular in the coastal areas. This calls for intensified control, which should include increased MDA treatment coverage, strengthening of bed net usage, and more male focus in LF health information dissemination. The low LF burdens observed in some inland districts suggest that MDA in these could be stepped down to provide more resources for upscale of control in the coastal areas. Monitoring should continue to guide the programme to ensure that the current major achievements will ultimately lead to successful LF elimination"

This study investigates the spatial and temporal pattern of RVF outbreaks in Tanzania over the past 80 years in order to guide prevention and control strategies.                                                     MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out based on disease reporting data from Tanzania at district or village level. The data were sourced from the Ministries responsible for livestock and human health, Tanzania Meteorological Agency and research institutions involved in RVF surveillance and diagnosis. The spatial distribution of outbreaks was mapped using ArcGIS 10. The space-time permutation model was applied to identify clusters of cases, and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors associated with the occurrence of outbreaks in the district.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: RVF outbreaks were reported between December and June in 1930, 1947, 1957, 1960, 1963, 1968, 1977-79, 1989, 1997-98 and 2006-07 in 39.2% of the districts in Tanzania. There was statistically significant spatio-temporal clustering of outbreaks. RVF occurrence was associated with the eastern Rift Valley ecosystem (OR = 6.14, CI: 1.96, 19.28), total amount of rainfall of >405.4 mm (OR = 12.36, CI: 3.06, 49.88), soil texture (clay [OR = 8.76, CI: 2.52, 30.50], and loam [OR = 8.79, CI: 2.04, 37.82]).                    CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: RVF outbreaks were found to be distributed heterogeneously and transmission dynamics appeared to vary between areas. The sequence of outbreak waves, continuously cover more parts of the country. Whenever infection has been introduced into an area, it is likely to be involved in future outbreaks. The cases were more likely to be reported from the eastern Rift Valley than from the western Rift Valley ecosystem and from areas with clay and loam rather than sandy soil texture."

Certain M. tuberculosis genotypes/lineages have been shown to be more likely to cause active TB in human populations from a distinct genetic ancestry. This study describes the genetic biodiversity of M. tuberculosis genotypes in Mwanza city, Tanzania and the clinical presentation of the disease caused by isolates of different lineages. Methods Two-hundred-fifty-two isolates from pulmonary TB patients in Mwanza, Tanzania were characterized by spoligotyping, and 45 isolates were further characterized by mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR). The patients' level of the acute phase reactants AGP, CRP and neutrophil counts, in addition to BMI, were measured and compared to the M. tuberculosis lineage of the infectious agent for each patient. Results The most frequent genotype was ST59 (48 out of 248 [19.4%]), belonging to the Euro- American lineage LAM11_ZWE, followed by ST21 (CAS_KILI lineage [44 out of 248 [17.7%]). A low degree of diversity (15.7% [39 different ST's out of 248 isolates]) of genotypes, in addition to a high level of mixed M. tuberculosis sub-populations among isolates with an unreported spoligotype pattern (10 out of 20 isolates [50.0%]) and isolates belonging to the ST53 lineage (13 out of 25 [52%]) was observed. Isolates of the 'modern' (TbD1-) Euro-American lineage induced higher levels of ?1-acid glycoprotein (? = 0.4, P = 0.02; 95% CI [0.06-0.66]) and neutrophil counts (? = 0.9, P = 0.02; 95% CI [0.12-1.64]) and had lower BMI score (? = -1.0, P = 0.04; 95% CI[-1.89 - (-0.03)]). LAM11_ZWE ('modern') isolates induced higher levels of CRP (? = 24.4, P = 0.05; 95% CI[0.24-48.63]) and neutrophil counts (? = 0.9, P = 0.03; 95% CI[0.09-1.70]). Conclusion The low diversity of genotypes may be explained by an evolutionary advantage of the most common lineages over other lineages combined with optimal conditions for transmission, such as overcrowding and inadequate ventilation. The induction of higher levels of acute phase reactants in patients infected by 'modern' lineage isolates compared to 'ancient' lineages may suggest increased virulence among 'modern' lineage isolates."

Camels have only recently been introduced into Tanzania and, as a result, there is no credible diseases status information concerning this population, estimated to be in the low hundreds. As part of a broader study on camel diseases in different localities of northern Tanzania, serum samples (n?=?109) were collected from apparently healthy, non-vaccinated camels during the period June to August 2010 and tested for antibodies specific to RVF virus (RVFV) using the inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Overall, herd and individual camel IgG seroprevalence was 78.5 % (11/14) and 27.5 % (30/109), respectively. IgG was found to be most prevalent in camels from Kilindi and Hai districts (45 %, each) and in introduced camels from other areas (37.1 %). The relationship between age and seropositivity showed that the seroprevalence was the highest (84.6 %) in age group of ?10 years and lowest (11.9 %) in age group of ?5 years.The results of this study reveal that evidence of camels being exposed to RVFV and that the risk of seropositivity varied according to district, being higher in Kilindi and Hai compared with other districts sampled. The risk of seropositivity increased with increasing animal age and the introduction of camels into the herd. Based on these study findings, continuous disease surveillance of camels for RVFV is indicated."

Methods: An open cohort study was established since 1994 with demographic surveillance system (DSS) and five serological surveys conducted. Deaths from Kisesa DSS were used to estimate mortality rates and 95% confidence intervals by HIV status for 3? 5?year periods (1995–1999, 2000–2004, and 2005–2009). Assuming that mortality rates in individuals who did not test for HIV are similar to those in tested individuals, and dependent on age, sex and HIV status and HIV, prevalence was estimated.

In 2000–2004, mortality rates were 43.3 (95% CI 36.2–51.9) in HIV positive, 3.3 (95% CI 2.8–4.0) in HIV negative and 11.9 (95% CI10.5–13.6) in untested. In 2005–2009, mortality rates were 30.7 (95% CI 24.8–38.0) in HIV positive, 4.1 (95% CI 3.5–4.9) in HIV negative and 5.7 (95% CI 5.0–6.6) in untested residents. In the three survey periods (1995–1999, 2000–2004, 2005–2009), the adjusted period prevalences of HIV, including the untested, were 13.5%, 11.6% and 7.1%, compared with the observed prevalence in the tested of 6.0%, 6.8 and 8.0%. The estimated prevalence in the untested was 33.4%, 21.6% and 6.1% in the three survey periods.

There was strong evidence of association with the HBB, ABO, ATP2B4, G6PD and CD40LG loci but previously reported associations at 22 other loci did not replicate in the multi-centre analysis. The large sample size made it possible to identify authentic genetic effects that are heterogeneous across populations or phenotypes, a striking example being the main African form of G6PD deficiency, which reduced the risk of cerebral malaria but increased the risk of severe malarial anaemia. The finding that G6PD deficiency has opposing effects on different fatal complications of P. falciparum infection indicates that the evolutionary origins of this common human genetic disorder are more complex than previously supposed."

Little has been done to understand the nature of parent-child connectedness, the structural factors that impact on connectedness and parents' understanding of how connectedness affects their children's sexual behaviour in sub-Saharan Africa and Tanzania in particular. Ethnographic research involved 30 days of observation in 10 households, 9 focus group discussions and 60 in-depth interviews. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVIVO qualitative data analysis software. The structural factors with greatest influence on connectedness were economic circumstances, gender, social status, state education, and globalisation. Economic circumstances impacted on parent-child connectedness through parents' ability to provide for their children's material needs, and the time their occupation allowed for them to spend with their children and monitor their activities. Appropriate parent-child interactions were shaped by gender norms and by social status in the form of respectability, adolescents' adherence to norms of respect/obedience shaping their parents' affection. State education affected parents' preferences between children but also undermined parental authority, as did broader globalisation. Connectedness was related to SRH in a bi-directional way: lack of connectedness was linked to young people's low self-esteem and risky sexual behaviour while unplanned pregnancies seriously undermined young women's connectedness with their parents. Since material provision was perceived to be a central element of parent-child connectedness, structural factors limiting provision made transactional sex more likely both through direct material pathways and emotional ones. Motives for transactional sex were said to be material needs and to feel loved and cared for. An important pathway by which structural factors shape adolescent SRH outcomes is through parent-child connectedness, especially parents' ability to spend time with their children and provide for their economic needs. Modifying these structural factors should facilitate parent-child connectedness, which may help delay early sexual intercourse, protect young people against unplanned pregnancy through encouraging communication on contraception use and, overall, promote healthy adolescent development."

High vaccine-induced antibody titres to the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antigen have been associated with protection from infection and episodes of clinical malaria. Using data from 5,144 participants in nine phase 2 trials, we explore predictors of vaccine immunogenicity (anti-CSP antibody titres), decay in antibody titres, and the association between antibody titres and clinical outcomes. We use empirically-observed relationships between these factors to predict vaccine efficacy in a range of scenarios. Vaccine-induced anti-CSP antibody titres were significantly associated with age (P = 0.04), adjuvant (P <0.001), pre-vaccination anti-hepatitis B surface antigen titres (P = 0.005) and pre-vaccination anti-CSP titres (P <0.001). Co-administration with other vaccines reduced anti-CSP antibody titres although not significantly (P = 0.095). Antibody titres showed a bi-phasic decay over time with an initial rapid decay in the first three months and a second slower decay over the next three to four years. Antibody titres were significantly associated with protection, with a titre of 51 (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 29 to 85) ELISA units/ml (EU/mL) predicted to prevent 50% of infections in children. Vaccine efficacy was predicted to decline to zero over four years in a setting with entomological inoculation rate (EIR) = 20 infectious bites per year (ibpy). Over a five-year follow-up period at an EIR = 20 ibpy, we predict RTS,S will avert 1,782 cases per 1,000 vaccinated children, 1,452 cases per 1,000 vaccinated infants, and 887 cases per 1,000 infants when co-administered with expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) vaccines. Our main study limitations include an absence of vaccine-induced cellular immune responses and short duration of follow-up in some individuals. Vaccine-induced anti-CSP antibody titres and transmission intensity can explain variations in observed vaccine efficacy."

Trial harm and tolerability assessments rely, in part, on participants' reports of medical histories, adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medications. Optimal methods for questioning participants are unclear, but different methods giving different results can undermine meta-analyses. This study compared methods for eliciting such data and explored reasons for dissimilar participant responses.                                                                                                                              METHODS: Participants from open-label antimalarial and antiretroviral interaction trials in two distinct sites (South Africa, n = 18 [all HIV positive]; Tanzania, n = 80 [86% HIV positive]) were asked about ill health and treatment use by sequential use of (1) general enquiries without reference to particular conditions, body systems or treatments, (2) checklists of potential health issues and treatments, (3) in-depth interviews. Participants' experiences of illness and treatment and their reporting behavior were explored qualitatively, as were trial clinicians' experiences with obtaining participant reports. Outcomes were the number and nature of data by questioning method, themes from qualitative analyses and a theoretical interpretation of participants' experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    RESULTS: There was an overall cumulative increase in the number of reports from general enquiry through checklists to in-depth interview; in South Africa, an additional 12 medical histories, 21 AEs and 27 medications; in Tanzania an additional 260 medical histories, 1 AE and 11 medications. Checklists and interviews facilitated recognition of health issues and treatments, and consideration of what to report. Information was sometimes not reported because participants forgot, it was considered irrelevant or insignificant, or they feared reporting. Some medicine names were not known and answers to questions were considered inferior to blood tests for detecting ill health. South African inpatient volunteers exhibited a ""trial citizenship"", working to achieve researchers' goals, while Tanzanian outpatients sometimes deferred responsibility for identifying items to report to trial clinicians.                             CONCLUSIONS: Questioning methods and trial contexts influence the detection of adverse events, medical histories and concomitant medications. There should be further methodological work to investigate these influences and find appropriate questioning methods."

Participation of sub-Saharan Africa in the conduct of HIV trials is crucial as this region still experiences high HIV incidences. We describe the experience of recruiting and retaining volunteers in the first HIV vaccine trial (HIVIS03) in   METHODS: In this trial enrolled volunteers from amongst Police Officers (POs) in Dar es Salaam were primed with HIV-1 DNA vaccine at months 0, 1 and 3; and boosted with HIV-1 MVA vaccine at months 9 and 21. A stepwise education provision/sensitization approach was employed to eventual recruitment. Having identified a ""core"" group of POs keen on HIV prevention activities, those interested to participate in the vaccine trial were invited for a first screening session that comprised of provision of detailed study information and medical evaluation. In the second screening session results of the initial assessment were provided and those eligible were assessed for willingness to participate (WTP). Those willing were consented and eventually randomized into the trial having met the eligibility criteria. Voluntary participation was emphasized throughout.                                                                                      RESULTS: Out of 408 POs who formed the core group, 364 (89.0%) attended the educational sessions. 263 out of 364 (72.2%) indicated willingness to participate in the HIV vaccine trial. 98% of those indicating WTP attended the pre-screening workshops. 220 (85.0%) indicated willingness to undergo first screening and 177 POs attended for initial screenings, of whom 162 (91.5%) underwent both clinical and laboratory screenings. 119 volunteers (73.5%) were eligible for the study. 79 were randomized into the trial, while 19 did not turn up, the major reason being partner/family advice. 60 volunteers including 15 females were recruited during a one-year period. All participated in the planned progress updates workshops. Retention into the schedule was: 98% for the 3 DNA/placebo vaccinations, while it was 83% and 73% for the first and second MVA/placebo vaccinations respectively.                                          CONCLUSION: In this first HIV vaccine trial in Tanzania, we successfully recruited the volunteers and there was no significant loss to follow up. Close contact and updates on study progress facilitated the observed retention rates."

Recent studies have shown a great diversity of paramyxoviruses in an urban-roosting population of straw-colored fruit bats in Ghana. Here, we investigate this further through virus isolation and describe two novel rubulaviruses: Achimota virus 1 (AchPV1) and Achimota virus 2 (AchPV2). The viruses form a phylogenetic cluster with each other and other bat-derived rubulaviruses, such as Tuhoko viruses, Menangle virus, and Tioman virus. We developed AchPV1- and AchPV2-specific serological assays and found evidence of infection with both viruses in Eidolon helvum across sub-Saharan Africa and on islands in the Gulf of Guinea. Longitudinal sampling of E. helvum indicates virus persistence within fruit bat populations and suggests spread of AchPVs via horizontal transmission. We also detected possible serological evidence of human infection with AchPV2 in Ghana and Tanzania. It is likely that clinically significant zoonotic spillover of chiropteran paramyxoviruses could be missed throughout much of Africa where health surveillance and diagnostics are poor and comorbidities, such as infection with HIV or Plasmodium sp., are common."

Early results show significant, albeit partial, protection against clinical malaria and severe malaria. To ascertain variations in vaccine efficacy according to covariates such as transmission intensity, choice of adjuvant, age at vaccination, and bednet use, we did an individual-participant pooled analysis of phase 2 clinical data.                                                                                                                                                                                                METHODS: We analysed data from 11 different sites in Africa, including 4453 participants. We measured heterogeneity in vaccine efficacy by estimating the interactions between covariates and vaccination in pooled multivariable Cox regression and Poisson regression analyses. Endpoints for measurement of vaccine efficacy were infection, clinical malaria, severe malaria, and death. We defined transmission intensity levels according to the estimated local parasite prevalence in children aged 2-10 years (PrP????), ranging from 5% to 80%. Choice of adjuvant was either AS01 or AS02.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      FINDINGS: Vaccine efficacy against all episodes of clinical malaria varied by transmission intensity (p=0·001). At low transmission (PrP???? 10%) vaccine efficacy was 60% (95% CI 54 to 67), at moderate transmission (PrP???? 20%) it was 41% (21 to 57), and at high transmission (PrP???? 70%) the efficacy was 4% (-10 to 22). Vaccine efficacy also varied by adjuvant choice (p<0·0001)--eg, at low transmission (PrP???? 10%), efficacy varied from 60% (95% CI 54 to 67) for AS01 to 47% (14 to 75) for AS02. Variations in efficacy by age at vaccination were of borderline significance (p=0·038), and bednet use and sex were not significant covariates. Vaccine efficacy (pooled across adjuvant choice and transmission intensity) varied significantly (p<0·0001) according to time since vaccination, from 36% efficacy (95% CI 24 to 45) at time of vaccination to 0% (-38 to 38) after 3 years.                                             INTERPRETATION: Vaccine efficacy against clinical disease was of limited duration and was not detectable 3 years after vaccination. Furthermore, efficacy fell with increasing transmission intensity. Outcomes after vaccination cannot be gauged accurately on the basis of one pooled efficacy figure. However, predictions of public-health outcomes of vaccination will need to take account of variations in efficacy by transmission intensity and by time since vaccination.

This process drives pathologies, and severe childhood malaria has been associated with the expression of particular subsets of PfEMP1 molecules. PfEMP1 are grouped into subtypes based on upstream sequences and the presence of semi-conserved PfEMP1 domain compositions named domain cassettes (DCs). Earlier studies have indicated that DC5-containing PfEMP1 (DC5-PfEMP1) are more likely to be expressed in children with severe malaria disease than in children with uncomplicated malaria, but these PfEMP1 subtypes only dominate in a relatively small proportion of the children with severe disease. In this study, we have characterised the genomic sequence characteristic for DC5, and show that two genetically different parasite lines expressing DC5-PfEMP1 bind PECAM1, and that anti-DC5-specific antibodies inhibit binding of DC5-PfEMP1-expressing parasites to transformed human bone marrow endothelial cells (TrHBMEC). We also show that antibodies against each of the four domains characteristic for DC5 react with native PfEMP1 expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes, and that some of these antibodies are cross-reactive between the two DC5-containing PfEMP1 molecules tested. Finally, we confirm that anti-DC5 antibodies are acquired early in life by individuals living in malaria endemic areas, that individuals having high levels of these antibodies are less likely to develop febrile malaria episodes and that the antibody levels correlate positively with hemoglobin levels."

Unfortunately, however, a specific issue has been misrepresented in the current debate. Verbal autopsy (VA) is an important underlying concept for all mortality studies in which complete death registration data are unavailable. The GBD response by Theo Vos and colleagues2 stated that they excluded diagnoses derived using the InterVA model,3 alleging poor validity in relation to physician-coded causes. Although their assertion was supported by citing a previous GBD study, it is contradicted by most peer-reviewed literature about this subject. Of more than 50 relevant publications, a particular study of more than 54?000 VA cases from five countries reported strong equivalence between InterVA diagnosis and physician coding.4 Paradoxically in this context, the series of papers from the INDEPTH Network analysing more than 110?000 deaths from Africa and Asia using InterVA reported cause-specific mortality rates that were highly congruent with corresponding GBD estimates.5 Furthermore, another study using data from the ALPHA Network has shown the high specificity of InterVA in relation to known HIV status.6 I therefore call on the GBD group2 to adhere to their original intention “to incorporate all the available data”.7 Multifarious sources of data should be recognised as having their own strengths and weaknesses, and that is the raison d'être of complex modelling."

There is therefore a great need for reliable and valid public health tools for assessing AIDS mortality.                                                                                                                                 OBJECTIVE:The aim of this article is to validate the InterVA-4 verbal autopsy (VA) interpretative model within African populations where HIV sero-status is recorded on a prospective basis, and examine the distribution of cause-specific mortality among HIV-positive and HIV-negative people.                                                                                                                                 DESIGN:Data from six sites of the Alpha Network, including HIV sero-status and VA interviews, were pooled. VA data according to the 2012 WHO format were extracted, and processed using the InterVA-4 model into likely causes of death. The model was blinded to the sero-status data. Cases with known pre-mortem HIV infection status were used to determine the specificity with which InterVA-4 could attribute HIV/AIDS as a cause of death. Cause-specific mortality fractions by HIV infection status were calculated, and a person-time model was built to analyse adjusted cause-specific mortality rate ratios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        RESULTS: The InterVA-4 model identified HIV/AIDS-related deaths with a specificity of 90.1% (95% CI 88.7-91.4%). Overall sensitivity could not be calculated, because HIV-positive people die from a range of causes. In a person-time model including 1,739 deaths in 1,161,688 HIV-negative person-years observed and 2,890 deaths in 75,110 HIV-positive person-years observed, the mortality ratio HIV-positive:negative was 29.0 (95% CI 27.1-31.0), after adjustment for age, sex, and study site. Cause-specific HIV-positive:negative mortality ratios for acute respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS-related deaths, meningitis, tuberculosis, and malnutrition were higher than the all-cause ratio; all causes had HIV-positive:negative mortality ratios significantly higher than unity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            CONCLUSIONS: These results were generally consistent with relatively small post-mortem and hospital-based diagnosis studies in the literature. The high specificity in cause of death attribution achieved in relation to HIV status, and large differences between specific causes by HIV status, show that InterVA-4 is an effective and valid tool for assessing HIV-related mortality."

However, regular repeat testing by high-risk HIV-negative individuals is important for timely initiation of ART as part of the ‘treatment as prevention’ approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Aim:To investigate HCT use during a round of HIV serological surveillance in northwest Tanzania in 2010, and to explore rates of repeat testing between 2003 and 2010.                            MethodsHCT services were provided during the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds of serological surveillance in 2003–2004 (Sero-4), 2006–2007 (Sero-5) and 2010 (Sero-6). HCT services have also been available at a government-run health centre and at other clinics in the study area since 2005. Questionnaires administered during sero-surveys collected information on socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and reported previous use of HCT services.                                                                                                                                                                   Results: The proportion of participants using HCT increased from 9.4% at Sero-4 to 16.6% at Sero-5 and 25.5% at Sero-6. Among participants attending all three sero-survey rounds (n?=?2,010), the proportions using HCT twice or more were low, with 11.1% using the HCT service offered at sero-surveys twice or more, and 25.3% having tested twice or more if reported use of HCT outside of sero-surveys was taken into account. In multivariable analyses, individuals testing HIV-positive were less likely to repeat test than individuals testing HIV-negative (aOR 0.17, 95% CI 0.006–0.52).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Discussion/Conclusions: Although HCT service use increased over time, it was disappointing that the proportions ever testing and ever repeat-testing were not even larger, considering the increasing availability of HCT and ART in the study area. There was some evidence that HIV-negative people with higher risk sexual behaviours were most likely to repeat test, which was encouraging in terms of the potential to pick-up those at greatest risk of HIV-infection"

In 2008 the World Health Organization (WHO), recommended early initiation of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) to all HIV infected infants diagnosed within the first year of life, and since 2010, within the first two years of life, irrespective of CD4 count or WHO clinical stage. The study aims were to describe implementation of EID programs in three Tanzanian regions with differences in HIV prevalences and logistical set-up with regard to HIV DNA testing.                                                       Methods:Data were obtained by review of the prevention from mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) registers from 2009–2011 at the Reproductive and Child Health Clinics (RCH) and from the databases from the Care and Treatment Clinics (CTC) in all the three regions; Kilimanjaro, Mbeya and Tanga. Statistical tests used were Poisson regression model and rank sum test.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Results: During the period of 2009 – 2011 a total of 4,860 exposed infants were registered from the reviewed sites, of whom 4,292 (88.3%) were screened for HIV infection. Overall proportion of tested infants in the three regions increased from 77.2% in 2009 to 97.8% in 2011. A total of 452 (10.5%) were found to be HIV infected (judged by the result of the first test). The prevalence of HIV infection among infants was higher in Mbeya when compared to Kilimanjaro region RR?=?1.872 (95%CI?=?1.408 – 2.543) p < 0.001. However sample turnaround time was significantly shorter in both Mbeya (2.7 weeks) and Tanga (5.0 weeks) as compared to Kilimanjaro (7.0 weeks), p=<0.001. A substantial of loss to follow-up (LTFU) was evident at all stages of EID services in the period of 2009 to 2011. Among the infants who were receiving treatment, 61% were found to be LFTU during the review period.                                         Conclusion: The study showed an increase in testing of HIV exposed infants within the three years, there is large variations of HIV prevalence among the regions. Challenges like; sample turnaround time and LTFU must be overcome before this can translate into the intended goal of early initiation of lifelong lifesaving antiretroviral therapy for the infants."

Methods: Trained nurses interviewed 1651 women aged 18–39 years who self-screened for contraindications to COCs with the help of a poster at drug shops in Tanzania. Nurse assessment of the women served as the gold standard for comparison with self-assessment. Blood pressure was also measured onsite.                                                                                    Results: Nurses reported that 437 (26.5%) women were not eligible to use COCs, compared with 485 (29.4%) according to self-report. Overall, 133 (8.1%) women who said that they were eligible were deemed ineligible by nurses. The rate of ineligibility was artificially high owing to participant and nurse assessments that were incorrectly based on adverse effects of pill use and cultural reasons, and because of the sampling procedure, which intercepted women regardless of their reasons for visiting the drug shop. Adjusted rates of ineligibility were 8.6% and 12.7%, respectively, according to nurse and participant assessment. Both nurses and women underestimated the prevalence of hypertension in the present group.                    Conclusion: Self-screening among women in rural and peri-urban Tanzania with regard to contraindications to COC use was comparable to assessment by trained nurses."

PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases,2013,7,12,e2584,,29, Epub 2013 Dec 5,,,,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is targeted for global elimination through treatment of entire at-risk populations with repeated annual mass drug administration (MDA). Essential for program success is defining and confirming the appropriate endpoint for MDA when transmission is presumed to have reached a level low enough that it cannot be sustained even in the absence of drug intervention. Guidelines advanced by WHO call for a transmission assessment survey (TAS) to determine if MDA can be stopped within an LF evaluation unit (EU) after at least five effective rounds of annual treatment. To test the value and practicality of these guidelines, a multicenter operational research trial was undertaken in 11 countries covering various geographic and epidemiological settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                          METHODOLOGY:The TAS was conducted twice in each EU with TAS-1 and TAS-2 approximately 24 months apart. Lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) formed the basis of the TAS survey design but specific EU characteristics defined the survey site (school or community), eligible population (6-7 year olds or 1(st)-2(nd) graders), survey type (systematic or cluster-sampling), target sample size, and critical cutoff (a statistically powered threshold below which transmission is expected to be no longer sustainable). The primary diagnostic tools were the immunochromatographic (ICT) test for W. bancrofti EUs and the BmR1 test (Brugia Rapid or PanLF) for Brugia spp. EUs.                                                                                                            PRINCIPAL FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS:In 10 of 11 EUs, the number of TAS-1 positive cases was below the critical cutoff, indicating that MDA could be stopped. The same results were found in the follow-up TAS-2, therefore, confirming the previous decision outcome. Sample sizes were highly sex and age-representative and closely matched the target value after factoring in estimates of non-participation. The TAS was determined to be a practical and effective evaluation tool for stopping MDA although its validity for longer-term post-MDA surveillance requires further investigation."

Recent evidence suggests that availability and affordability of ACTs in retail sector drug shops (where many people treat malaria) has increased under the AMFm, but it is unclear whether household level ACT use has increased.                                                                                                                                                                                              Methods and Findings: Household surveys were conducted in two remote regions of Tanzania (Mtwara and Rukwa) in three waves: March 2011, December 2011 and March 2012, corresponding to 3, 13 and 16 months into the AMFm implementation respectively. Information about suspected malaria episodes including treatment location and medications taken was collected. Respondents were also asked about antimalarial preferences and perceptions about the availability of these medications. Significant increases in ACT use, preference and perceived availability were found between Rounds 1 and 3 though not for all measures between Rounds 1 and 2. ACT use among suspected malaria episodes was 51.1% in March 2011 and increased by 10.9 percentage points by Round 3 (p?=?.017). The greatest increase was among retail sector patients, where ACT use increased from 31% in Round 1 to 49% in Round 2 (p?=?.037) and to 61% (p<.0001) by Round 3. The fraction of suspected malaria episodes treated in the retail sector increased from 30.2% in Round 1 to 46.7% in Round 3 (p?=?.0009), mostly due to a decrease in patients who sought no treatment at all. No significant changes in public sector treatment seeking were found.                                                                   Conclusions: The AMFm has led to significant increases in ACT use for suspected malaria, especially in the retail sector. No evidence is found supporting the concerns that the AMFm would crowd out public sector treatment or neglect patients in remote areas and from low SES groups"

Studies are needed assess the clinical relevance of azithromycin-associated resistance on treatment of pediatric infections.Background. Emerging evidence suggests that the mass distribution of azithromycin for trachoma control (MDA) may increase circulation of macrolide resistance in bacteria associated with severe pediatric infections in treated communities.Methods. We examined the effect of MDA on nasopharyngeal carriage of antibiotic-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae among 1015 young children living in rural Tanzania. MDA with a single dose of oral azithromycin was provided in 4 of 8 communities where trachoma prevalence was ?10%. Isolates were tested for susceptibility to azithromycin (AZM) and commonly used antibiotics by disk diffusion and Etest. We calculated the proportion of antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae carriage at baseline and again 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment, and at comparable intervals in the untreated villages.Results. The proportion of AZM-resistant isolates was similar between groups at baseline (MDA: 35.8% vs non-MDA: 35.4%), however, this proportion was greater in the MDA group in all subsequent surveys. At 6 months, the percentage of AZM-resistant isolates was significantly higher in the MDA group (81.9% vs 46.9%, P &lt; .001). The odds of AZM-resistant carriage was 5-fold greater in the MDA group (odds ratio, 4.95 [95% confidence interval, 3.23–7.61]). The proportion of isolates clinically resistant to AZM (minimum inhibitory concentration ?16 µg/mL) was also significantly greater in the MDA group at 6 months (35.3% vs 12.4%, P &lt; .006).Conclusions. Mass distribution of a single dose of oral azithromycin for trachoma was associated with increased circulation of macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae carriage among young children in the 6 months following treatment. It is crucial that changes in antibiotic resistance patterns and their clinical significance in the treatment of severe pediatric infections be assessed in future MDA trials."

Methods:  We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis through MEDLINE and EMBASE (up to January 2012), as well as direct author contact. Eligible studies provided summary or individual-level data on one or more of the following traits in HIV+ and HIV-, or ART+ and ART- subgroups in SSA: body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TGs) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Information was synthesized under a random-effects model and the primary outcomes were the standardized mean differences (SMD) of the specified traits between subgroups of participants.                    Results Data: were obtained from 49 published and 3 unpublished studies which reported on 29 755 individuals. HIV infection was associated with higher TGs [SMD, 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.08 to 0.44] and lower HDL (SMD, ?0.59; 95% CI, ?0.86 to ?0.31), BMI (SMD, ?0.32; 95% CI, ?0.45 to ?0.18), SBP (SMD, ?0.40; 95% CI, ?0.55 to ?0.25) and DBP (SMD, ?0.34; 95% CI, ?0.51 to ?0.17). Among HIV+ individuals, ART use was associated with higher LDL (SMD, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.72) and HDL (SMD, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.66), and lower HbA1c (SMD, ?0.34; 95% CI, ?0.62 to ?0.06). Fully adjusted estimates from analyses of individual participant data were consistent with meta-analysis of summary estimates for most traits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Conclusions :Broadly consistent with results from populations of European descent, these results suggest differences in cardiometabolic traits between HIV-infected and uninfected individuals in SSA, which might be modified by ART use. In a region with the highest burden of HIV, it will be important to clarify these findings to reliably assess the need for monitoring and managing cardiometabolic risk in HIV-infected "

Macroscopic cervical abnormalities were also quantified. After 6 months, microscopically detectable egg excretion was eliminated, but 8 of 33 women (24%) were persistently positive for S. haematobium by PCR, and 11 (33%) had cervical abnormalities potentially attributable to schistosomiasis. This suggests that praziquantel treatment more frequently than every 6 months may be necessary for complete elimination of the parasite and prevention of genital tissue pathology. This aggressive therapy may in turn play a key role decreasing HIV susceptibility in millions of people living in regions in which S. haematobium is endemic."

While these shops are only licensed to sell non-prescription drugs are required to be headed by someone with basic medical training research shows that in Tanzania some drug store attendants have no health related training and regularly sell prescription-only medicines without a license. The researchers have designed an intervention to facilitate access to prescriptions by patients and drug stores using the mobile phone short-message service (SMS) to improve referral to formal health facilities. Mobile telephony is among the fastest growing resources in Africa. Up to 95% of Tanzania’s population has access to a mobile phone. Previous work suggests that mobile phones can improve access to and delivery of health services in sub-Saharan Africa. This intervention is designed to improve access to safe prescriptions and uptake of effective reproductive health services.

BMC Human Resources for Health 11:28", Gender-based distributional skewness of the United Republic of Tanzania's health workforce cadres: a cross-sectional health facility survey,health facility,BMC Human Resources for Health ,2013,11,,28,,6,,,,,,,,,"Background: While severe shortages, inadequate skills and a geographical imbalance of health personnel have been consistently documented over the years as long term critical challenges in the health sector of the United Republic of Tanzania, there is limited evidence on the gender-based distribution of the health workforce and its likely implications. Extant evidence shows that some people may not seek healthcare unless they have access to a provider of their gender. This paper, therefore, assesses the gender-based distribution of the United Republic of Tanzania’s health workforce cadres.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Methods: This is a secondary analysis of data collected in a cross-sectional health facility survey on health system strengthening in the United Republic of Tanzania in 2008. During the survey, 88 health facilities, selected randomly from 8 regions, yielded 815 health workers (HWs) eligible for the current analysis. While Chi-square was used for testing associations in the bivariate analysis, multivariate analysis was conducted using logistic regression to assess the relationship between gender and each of the cadres involved in the analysis.                  Results: The mean age of the HWs was 39.7, ranging from 15 to 63 years. Overall, 75% of the HWs were women. The proportion of women among maternal and child health aides or medical attendants (MCHA/MA), nurses and midwives was 86%, 86% and 91%, respectively, while their proportion among clinical officers (COs) and medical doctors (MDs) was 28% and 21%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) that a HW was a female (baseline category is “male”) for each cadre was: MCHA/MA, OR?=?3.70, 95% CI 2.16-6.33; nurse, OR?=?5.61, 95% CI 3.22-9.78; midwife, OR?=?2.74, 95% CI 1.44-5.20; CO, OR?=?0.08, 95% CI 0.04-0.17 and MD, OR?=?0.04, 95% CI 0.02-0.09.      Conclusion: The distribution of the United Republic of Tanzania’s health cadres is dramatically gender-skewed, a reflection of gender inequality in health career choices. MCHA/MA, nursing and midwifery cadres are large and female-dominant, whereas COs and MDs are fewer in absolute numbers and male-dominant. While a need for more staff is necessary for an effective delivery of quality health services, adequate representation of women in highly trained cadres is imperative to enhance responses to some gender-specific roles and needs."

We assessed the role of diabetes on sputum culture conversion and mortality among patients undergoing TB treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                        METHODS:A total of 1250 Tanzanian TB patients were followed prospectively during TB treatment with sputum culture after 2 and 5 months. Survival status was assessed at least 1 year after initiation of treatment. At baseline, all participants underwent testing for diabetes and HIV, and the serum concentration of the acute phase reactant alpha-1 glycoprotein (AGP) was determined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     RESULTS: There were no differences between participants with and without diabetes regarding the proportion of positive cultures at 2 (3.8% vs. 5.8%) and 5 (1.3% vs. 0.9%) months (P > 0.46). However, among patients with a positive TB culture, relatively more patients with diabetes died before the 5-month follow-up. Within the initial 100 days of TB treatment, diabetes was associated with a fivefold increased risk of mortality (RR 5.09, 95% CI 2.36; 11.02, P < 0.001) among HIV uninfected, and a twofold increase among HIV co-infected patient (RR 2.33 95% CI 1.20; 4.53, P = 0.012), while diabetes was not associated with long-term mortality. Further adjustment with AGP did not change the estimates.                                     CONCLUSION:Diabetes considerably increases risk of early mortality during TB treatment. The effect may not be explained by increased severity of TB, but could be due to impaired TB treatment response. Research is needed to clarify the mechanism and to assess whether glycaemic control improves survival."

Sputum-positive [eB 0·43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·29–0·64] and sputum-negative (eB 0·67, 95% CI 0·47–0·94) TB as well as HIV infection (eB 0·59, 95% CI 0·46–0·75) were associated with reduced activity compared to controls. Anaemia accounted for a substantial part of the effects of HIV, while elevated AGP primarily mediated the TB effect. The level of physical activity is highly influenced by TB and HIV, and mainly mediated through anaemia of infection and associated with elevated acute phase response."

The Xpert® MTB/RIF assay is a commercially available real-time PCR that detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific DNA sequences in sputum samples. Methods Sputum samples from 221 patients with smear-positive tuberculosis enrolled in a multi-centre randomized clinical trial of anti-tuberculosis treatment were analysed weekly (weeks 0 to 8), then at weeks 12, 17, 22, 26 after treatment initiation. The Xpert® MTB/RIF results over time were compared with the results of standard smear and culture methods. Findings Xpert® MTB/RIF positivity rates declined slower than those of standard methods. At week 8, smear, solid culture, liquid culture, and the Xpert® MTB/RIF were positive in 29·2%, 26·3%, 42·1% and 84·1%, respectively, and at 26 weeks in 5·0%, 2·5%, 4·1%, and 26·5%, respectively. The decline of quantitative M. tuberculosis DNA detection via the Xpert® MTB/RIF correlated with smear grades (rho=-0·74; P<0·01), solid culture grades (rho=-0·73; P<0·01), and liquid culture time to positivity (rho=0·73; P<0·01). Compared to combined binary smear and culture results as reference standard, the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay had high sensitivity (97·0%) but poor specificity (48·6%). Interpretation Quantitative Xpert® MTB/RIF readouts correlate well with M tuberculosis smear and culture results during anti-tuberculosis treatment. The poor specificity precludes the use of Xpert® MTB/RIF assay as a biomarker for tuberculosis treatment monitoring."

DESIGN: Age-sex-matched cross-sectional study among PTB patients and non-TB controls.                                                                                                                                                                         METHODS: PTB patients were categorized as sputum negative (PTB-) and positive (PTB+) by culture. Non-TB controls were randomly selected among age-sex-matched neighbours to PTB+ patients. Height, weight, arm circumference and triceps skinfold were measured, and body mass index (BMI), arm fat (AFA) and muscle area (AMA) computed. HIV status, and S-25(OH)D, C-reactive protein (S-CRP) and ?1-acid glycoprotein (S-AGP) were determined. Linear regression analysis with controls and PTB patients combined was used to identify correlates of S-25(OH)D.

Time of recruitment, sex, PTB and HIV, and elevated S-AGP were correlates of S-25(OH)D. S-25(OH)D was 24.8 (95% CI 18.6;30.9) nmol/L higher in PTB compared to controls among females, but only 9.8 (95% CI:4.5;15.2) nmol/L among males (interaction p<0.0001). Females had 13.8 (95% CI:8.2;21.9) nmol/L lower S-25(OH)D than males, and HIV infected individuals had 8.5 (95% CI:4.9;12.1) higher S-25(OH)D compared to uninfected. Elevated S-AGP was a positive correlate of S-25(OH)D. Low BMI was associated with S-25(OH)D, but not with infections or S-AGP in the model.

Lipid-based Nutrient Supplements (LNS) can provide nutritional support and can be adapted to the needs of adults infected with HIV. However, consumption of these products may be limited by monotony or by an unacceptably strong taste of highly concentrated micronutrients. This study investigated the acceptability of several new flavours of LNS for HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Forty HIV-infected adults on ART completed acceptability tests with one of four sets of LNS products: LNS-30 g sweet, LNS-30 g non-sweet, LNS-250 g sweet and LNS-250 g non-sweet. Each set was composed of three flavours and was tasted with and without food during a single session of sensory evaluation. The supplements were block-randomised and the patients were blinded to the type of product. LNS acceptability was assessed based on descriptive, hedonic and food-action rating tests using 5-point rating scales as well as preference tests. All the flavours got a median rate of 3-Just about right for the intensity of sugar, salt, oil, thickness and 4-Good for the taste. Regarding the overall liking, the supplements were positively evaluated with median of 4-I like a little or 5-I like a lot. The LNS-30 g non-sweet formulation was significantly less appreciated when tasted without food compared to all the other sets of LNS (P = 0.0005). Mixing LNS with local food had no effect on the acceptability. In terms of consumption pattern, all the products got a median rate of 1-Will eat it at all opportunity or 2-Will eat it very often. Finally, in terms of preference there was no significant difference between the flavours. In LNS-30 g the overall liking was positively correlated with the taste and the intensity of sugar but the prospective consumption factor was negatively correlated with thickness. In LNS-250 g, only the intensity of salty taste was correlated with the overall liking. As the flavours were well accepted, all of them can be used, providing choice and variety to HIV-infected adults consuming them for prolonged periods. There is no need to modify the products’ formulation. Further research on the acceptability of these supplements over the longer term and in settings where food insecurity and dietary patterns are different is warranted."

A loading-dose regimen has been recommended for 30 years but is still often not used. A population pharmacokinetic study was conducted with 75 Tanzanian children aged 4 months to 8 years with severe malaria who received quinine intramuscularly; 69 patients received a loading dose of 20 mg quinine dihydrochloride (salt)/kg of body weight. Twenty-one patients had plasma quinine concentrations detectable at baseline. A zero-order absorption model with one-compartment disposition pharmacokinetics described the data adequately. Body weight was the only significant covariate and was implemented as an allometric function on clearance and volume parameters. Population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates (and percent relative standard errors [%RSE]) of elimination clearance, central volume of distribution, and duration of zero-order absorption were 0.977 liters/h (6.50%), 16.7 liters (6.39%), and 1.42 h (21.5%), respectively, for a typical patient weighing 11 kg. Quinine exposure was reduced at lower body weights after standard weight-based dosing; there was 18% less exposure over 24 h in patients weighing 5 kg than in those weighing 25 kg. Maximum plasma concentrations after the loading dose were unaffected by body weight. There was no evidence of dose-related drug toxicity with the loading dosing regimen. Intramuscular quinine is rapidly and reliably absorbed in children with severe falciparum malaria. Based on these pharmacokinetic data, a loading dose of 20 mg salt/kg is recommended, provided that no loading dose was administered within 24 h and no routine dose was administered within 12 h of admission.

Histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) is produced by Plasmodium falciparum, and its plasma concentration reflects the total body parasite burden. We aimed to define the malaria-attributable fraction of severe febrile illness, using the distributions of plasma P. falciparum HRP2 (PfHRP2) concentrations from parasitemic children with different clinical presentations.                                                                                                                                       METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from and peripheral blood slides prepared for 1435 children aged 6-60 months in communities and a nearby hospital in northeastern Tanzania. The study population included children with severe or uncomplicated malaria, asymptomatic carriers, and healthy control subjects who had negative results of rapid diagnostic tests. The distributions of plasma PfHRP2 concentrations among the different groups were used to model severe malaria-attributable disease.                                                            RESULTS: The plasma PfHRP2 concentration showed a close correlation with the severity of infection. PfHRP2 concentrations of >1000 ng/mL denoted a malaria-attributable fraction of severe disease of 99% (95% credible interval [CI], 96%-100%), with a sensitivity of 74% (95% CI, 72%-77%), whereas a concentration of <200 ng/mL denoted severe febrile illness of an alternative diagnosis in >10% (95% CI, 3%-27%) of patients. Bacteremia was more common among patients in the lowest and highest PfHRP2 concentration quintiles.                                    CONCLUSIONS:The plasma PfHRP2 concentration defines malaria-attributable disease and distinguishes severe malaria from coincidental parasitemia in African children in a moderate-to-high transmission setting."

A population pharmacokinetic study of ARS and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) was conducted from sparse sampling in 70 Tanzanian children of ages 6 months to 11 years. All the children had been admitted with severe falciparum malaria and were treated with intramuscular ARS (2.4?mg/kg at 0, 12, and 24?h). Venous plasma concentration-time profiles were characterized using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM). A one-compartment disposition model accurately described first-dose population pharmacokinetics of ARS and DHA. Body weight significantly affected clearance and apparent volume of distribution (P < 0.001), resulting in lower ARS and DHA exposure levels in smaller children. An adapted dosing regimen including a practical dosing table per weight band is proposed for young children based on the pharmacokinetic mode"

The present study evaluated the comparative efficacy for collection of Cx quinquefasciatus of four commercially available gravid traps: the CDC, Frommer Updraft, Reiter-Cummings and Harris County traps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         METHOD: Trap evaluations were conducted in two locations in Tanzania, Ifakara and Tanga. Mosquitoes collected were identified to species, sex, and gonotrophic status.                              RESULTS:In both locations, the CDC gravid trap collected the highest number of mosquitoes, the highest number of Cx quinquefasciatus, and the highest proportion of gravid mosquitoes. Although it damaged the highest proportion of mosquitoes as they passed through the trap fan, the CDC gravid trap also contained the highest number of living mosquitoes, when the traps were collected in the morning. The CDC gravid traps collected significantly more phlebotomine sandflies than the other traps and in Tanga, where they were more frequent, the highest number of biting midges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CONCLUSION: The effectiveness of all four gravid traps should encourage the sampling of Cx quinquefasciatus where it is an important disease vector or nuisance mosquito. The unexpected collection of phlebotomine sandflies and biting midges indicates that gravid traps might usefully collect other insects, including those of medical importance."

Previously, resistance was restricted to the island of Pemba while mosquitoes from Unguja, the larger of the two islands of Zanzibar, were susceptible. Here, we characterised the mechanism(s) responsible for resistance on Zanzibar using a combination of gene expression and target-site mutation assays. WHO resistance bioassays were conducted using 1-5d old adult Anopheles gambiae s.l. collected between 2011 and 2013 across the archipelago. Synergist assays with the P450 inhibitor piperonyl-butoxide were performed in 2013. Members of the An. gambiae complex were PCR-identified and screened for target-site mutations (kdr and Ace-1). Gene expression in pyrethroid resistant An. arabiensis from Pemba was analysed using whole-genome microarrays. Pyrethroid resistance is now present across the entire Zanzibar archipelago. Survival to the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin in bioassays conducted in 2013 was 23.5-54.3% on Unguja and 32.9-81.7% on Pemba. We present evidence that resistance is mediated, in part at least, by elevated P450 monoxygenases. Whole-genome microarray scans showed that the most enriched gene terms in resistant An. arabiensis from Pemba were associated with P450 activity and synergist assays with PBO completely restored susceptibility to pyrethroids in both islands. CYP4G16 was the most consistently over-expressed gene in resistant mosquitoes compared with two susceptible strains from Unguja and Dar es Salaam. Expression of this P450 is enriched in the abdomen and it is thought to play a role in hydrocarbon synthesis. Microarray and qPCR detected several additional genes putatively involved in this pathway enriched in the Pemba pyrethroid resistant population and we hypothesise that resistance may be, in part, related to alterations in the structure of the mosquito cuticle. None of the kdr target-site mutations, associated with pyrethroid/DDT resistance in An. gambiae elsewhere in Africa, were found on the islands. The consequences of this resistance phenotype are discussed in relation to future vector control strategies on Zanzibar to support the ongoing malaria elimination efforts on the island"

Diagnostic doses of the pyrethroids deltamethrin, lambdacyhalothrin and permethrin, the carbamate propoxur, the organophosphate fenitrothion and the organochlorine DDT were used. Anopheles gambiae s.l. was resistant to permethrin in Muleba, where a mortality rate of 11% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6-19%] was recorded, Muheza (mortality rate of 75%, 95% CI 66-83%), Moshi and Arumeru (mortality rates of 74% in both). Similarly, resistance was reported to lambdacyhalothrin in Muleba, Muheza, Moshi and Arumeru (mortality rates of 31-82%), and to deltamethrin in Muleba, Moshi and Muheza (mortality rates of 28-75%). Resistance to DDT was reported in Muleba. No resistance to the carbamate propoxur or the organophosphate fenitrothion was observed. Anopheles gambiae s.l. is becoming resistant to pyrethoids and DDT in several parts of Tanzania. This has coincided with the scaling up of vector control measures. Resistance may impair the effectiveness of these interventions and therefore demands close monitoring and the adoption of a resistance management strategy."

While Health Information System (HIS) is a system that integrates data collection, processing, reporting and use of the information necessary for improving health service effectiveness and efficiency through better management at all levels of health services. Method: A cross sectional study was conducted from April to June 2009 in Mbeya Region and at the national level to assess the factors affecting utilization of evidence based health information system for effective supply chain of EMs in Tanzania so as to develop strategies for valuable procurement at the facility and national levels. Quantitative data was collected from 33 health facilities (HFs) and qualitative data was collected from two focus group discussions and 23 different key informants from different levels of the EMs supply chain. Results: This study revealed the following main factors that affect utilisation and management of information system (IS): lack of strong IS at Medical Store Department and Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to manage the organization, suppliers and clients needs; lack of compliance to the national ordering and deliveries guideline and procedures; inadequate funds; low capacity in implementing integrated logistic system; lack of national representative data during annual budgeting and forecasting of EMs requirements; and political interests. Conclusion: In this study the supply chain of EMs at the HFs and central levels in Tanzania is not evidence-based. For effective utilization of HIS in the supply chain of EMs there is need to strengthen the capacity in the management and utilisation of HIS at facility, district and national levels."

This study was therefore conducted to explore perceptions on repeat HIV testing among members of the incidence study cohort that also served as a source of volunteers for subsequent HIV vaccine trials. This qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted in Dar es Salaam. The study included male and female Police Officers who were eligible to participate in the HIV incidence study. Participants were selected purposefully from eight Police stations out of the 32 stations. Data was collected using in-depth interviews and analysed qualitatively using the content analysis approach. A majority of participants were willing to undergo a repeat HIV test and stated that it was important to repeat an HIV test to confirm their health status, and hence continue protecting themselves. Participants who participated in a repeat HIV test as a part of incidence study reported that the repeat HIV testing process was acceptable because counselling was provided, testing was voluntary, there was trust in the health care providers and a freedom to choose where to test. Participants who did not repeat the HIV test held that repeat a HIV test was not necessary since they believed that the initial test was adequate. Others said that communication breakdown was the main cause as they weren't aware of the importance of a repeat HIV test. Fear of the test results was also mentioned as one of the reasons. The participants were eager to gain more knowledge about the importance of a repeat HIV test. In order to facilitate repeat HIV testing in potential cohorts for HIV vaccine trials, more information and education regarding the repeat HIV test is needed. It is also important to make sure that researchers are well informed on what study participants are supposed to know."

DESIGN: Nine-year audit of country-wide programme data from 2002 to 2010.RESULTS: Of the 40?940 retreatment TB patients notified by the NTLP, 3871 (10%) had their sputum samples received at the reference and zonal laboratories for culture and DST. A total of 3761 (97%) sputum samples were processed for culture, of which 1589 (42%) were found to be culture-positive and 1415 (89%) had DST performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 CONCLUSIONS: There is a >90% shortfall between notified retreatment cases and numbers of sputum samples received, cultured and assessed for DST at reference and zonal laboratories. Steps needed to address this problem are discussed."

Failure to diagnose and adequately treat TB could lead to premature death and unrecognized transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The proportion of missed TB cases has not been reported in Tanzania. The objective of this study was to quantify the number of cases of TB identified by autopsy. Deceased morbid bodies from Muhimbili National Hospital were involved. Retrieval of admission, diagnostic and other important records used to manage the patient after admission was done. Demographic information, site and type of disease, past medical history, chest x-ray report, clinical diagnosis and cause of death reported upon death certification were recorded. Lung tissues, lymphnodes and blood clots for HIV testing were collected. Biopsy tissues were processed through Ziehl Nielsen staining and examined by microscopy. The study involved 74 deceased individuals where 56 (75.7%) were males. Information for duration of seeking health care before death was available for 41(55.4%) subjects. Thirty-four (45.9%) cases received diagnosis before death. The main diagnoses were pneumonia 10(13.5%), heart failure 6(8.1%), AIDS-related illnesses 6 (6.8%) and malaria 5 (6.8%). The main clinical findings were wasting (51/74 (68.9%)) and abnormal fluid collection in different body cavities, 61(50.8%). In 24 out of 71(33.8%) biopsies acid fast bacilli (AFB) were detected. Records of lymphnodes examination were available in 63 cases and 22 of them had AFB. Twenty-two (34.9%) from the paratracheal and hilar lymphnodes were observed to have AFB. HIV was detected by ELISA in 19 (33.3%) out of 57 deceased, and 12 (63.2%) of the HIV positive deceased were co-infected with TB. Out of the 22 cases positive for AFB on tissue-biopsies 12 (54.5%) were HIV positive. There is a high number of TB cases diagnosed after death that could not be detected before they died. There is a need for increased awareness and to include postmortem data in the annual statistics of TB for precise reporting of the magnitude of the TB burden in the country."

This region carries almost 90% of all global cases of malaria. Currently, a number of reports indicate that the population of malaria vectors and the percentage of malaria cases are declining in sub-Saharan Africa. The reports further indicate that the significant reductions of malaria morbidity and mortality are more observed in high-risk groups, including pregnant women and children under the age of 5. The decline in malaria prevalence and transmission has been reported mostly in areas that received massive distributions of malaria-intervention tools and in areas where clinical trials have been conducted. However, the main challenges facing the success stories of malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa are the sustainability of the intervention programs, increase of malarial vector population, and malarial parasites' resistance to insecticides, and artemisinin-based combination therapy. Here, we discuss a number of factors which in one way or another may potentially affect the gains so far achieved in the control of malaria in Africa."

Expanding access to effective treatment in private drug shops may help reduce incidence of severe disease and mortality. This research leveraged a longitudinal survey of stocking of subsidized artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), an effective anti-malarial, in Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlets (ADDOs) in two regions of Tanzania. This provided a unique opportunity to explore shop and market level determinants of product diffusion in a developing country retail market. 356 ADDOs in the Rukwa and Mtwara regions of Tanzania were surveyed at seven points between Feb 2011 and May 2012. Shop level audits were used to measure the availability of subsidized ACTs at each shop. Data on market and shop level factors were collected during the survey and also extracted from GIS layers. Regression and network based methodologies were used. Shops classified as early and late adopters, following Rogers' model of product diffusion, were compared. The Bass model of product diffusion was applied to determine whether shops stocked ACTs out of a need to imitate market competitors or a desire to satisfy customer needs. Following the introduction of a subsidy for ACTs, stocking increased from 12% to nearly 80% over the seven survey rounds. Stocking was influenced by higher numbers of proximal shops and clinics, larger customer traffic and the presence of a licensed pharmacist. Early adopters were characterized by a larger percentage of customers seeking care for malaria, a larger catchment and sourcing from specific wholesalers/suppliers. The Bass model of product diffusion indicated that shops were adopting products in response to competitor behavior, rather than customer demand. Decisions to stock new pharmaceutical products in Tanzanian ADDOs are influenced by a combination of factors related to both market competition and customer demand, but are particularly influenced by the behavior of competing shops. Efforts to expand access to new pharmaceutical products in developing country markets could benefit from initial targeting of high profile shops in competitive markets and wholesale suppliers to encourage faster product diffusion across all drug retailers."

RESULTS: HSV-2 infection was strongly associated with HIV infection (females: adjOR 4.4, 95%CI 3.2-6.1; males: adjOR 4.2, 95%CI 2.8-6.2). Several socio-demographic factors (such as age, marital status and mobility), behavioural factors (condom use, number and type of sexual partnerships) and biological factors (blood transfusion, lifetime pregnancies, genital ulcers, Neisseria gonorrhoeae) were also associated with HIV infection. Among females, lifetime sexual partners (linear trend, p<0.001), ?2 partners in the past year (adjOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.4-2.8), ?2 new partners in the past year (adjOR 1.9 95%CI 1.2, 3.3) and concurrent partners in the past year (adjOR 1.6 95%CI 1.1, 2.4) were all associated with HIV infection.                    CONCLUSIONS: Efforts must be intensified to find effective interventions to reduce HSV-2. Effective behavioural interventions focusing on reducing the number of sexual partnerships and risk behaviour within partnerships are also needed. An increase in risky sexual behaviour may occur following marriage dissolution or when a young woman travels outside of her community and interventions addressing the needs of these subgroups of vulnerable women may be important."

It becomes even more challenging when local languages do not have equivalent scientific and technical vocabularies, rendering communication of scientific concepts in translated documents extremely difficult. Even when bilingual lexicons are developed, there is no guarantee that participants understand the terminology as translated.                                                                             METHODS: We conducted twelve focus groups with women of reproductive age in Mwanza, Tanzania to explore the effectiveness of four questioning techniques for: (1) assessing participants' familiarity with existing technical terms and concepts, (2) generating a list of acceptable technical and non-technical terms, (3) testing our definitions of technical terms, and (4) verifying participants' preferences for terms. Focus groups were transcribed, translated, and qualitatively analyzed.                                                                                                           RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A translation process that uses all four questioning techniques in a step-wise approach is an effective way to establish a baseline understanding of participants' familiarity with research terms, to develop and test translatable definitions, and to identify participants' preferred terminology for international HIV clinical research. This may help to ensure that important concepts are not ""lost in translation."" The results emphasize the importance of using a variety of techniques depending on the level of participant familiarity with research concepts, the existence of colloquial or technical terms in the target language, and the inherent complexity of the terms."

We explored the effect of boluses on 48-hour all-cause mortality byclinical presentation at enrolment, hemodynamic changes over the first hour, andon different modes of death, according to terminal clinical events. We hypothesizethat boluses may cause excess deaths from neurological or respiratory eventsrelating to fluid overload.                                                                Methods: Pre-defined presentation syndromes (PS; severe acidosis or severe shock,respiratory, neurological) and predominant terminal clinical events(cardiovascular collapse, respiratory, neurological) were described by randomizedarm (bolus versus control) in 3,141 severely ill febrile children with shockenrolled in the Fluid Expansion as Supportive Therapy (FEAST) trial. Landmarkanalyses were used to compare early mortality in treatment groups, conditional onchanges in shock and hypoxia parameters. Competing risks methods were used toestimate cumulative incidence curves and sub-hazard ratios to compare treatmentgroups in terms of terminal clinical events.                                                                                            Results:Of 2,396 out of 3,141 (76%) classifiable participants, 1,647 (69%) had a severemetabolic acidosis or severe shock PS, 625 (26%) had a respiratory PS and 976(41%) had a neurological PS, either alone or in combination. Mortality wasgreatest among children fulfilling criteria for all three PS (28% bolus, 21%control) and lowest for lone respiratory (2% bolus, 5% control) or neurological(3% bolus, 0% control) presentations. Excess mortality in bolus arms versuscontrol was apparent for all three PS, including all their component features. Byone hour, shock had resolved (responders) more frequently in bolus versus controlgroups (43% versus 32%, P <0.001), but excess mortality with boluseswas evident in responders (relative risk 1.98, 95% confidence interval 0.94 to4.17, P = 0.06) and 'non-responders' (relative risk 1.67, 95% confidenceinterval 1.23 to 2.28, P = 0.001), with no evidence of heterogeneity(P = 0.68). The major difference between bolus and control arms wasthe higher proportion of cardiogenic or shock terminal clinical events in bolusarms (n = 123; 4.6% versus 2.6%, P = 0.008) rather than respiratory (n =61; 2.2% versus 1.3%, P = 0.09) or neurological (n = 63, 2.1% versus1.8%, P = 0.6) terminal clinical events.                                          Conclusions: Excess mortality from boluses occurred in all subgroups of children. Contrary toexpectation, cardiovascular collapse rather than fluid overload appeared tocontribute most to excess deaths with rapid fluid resuscitation. These resultsshould prompt a re-evaluation of evidence on fluid resuscitation for shock and are-appraisal of the rate, composition and volume of resuscitation fluids."

Human Landing Catch (HLC) is currently the only method that can directly and consistently measure the biting rates of anthropophagic mosquitoes, both indoors and outdoors. However, this method exposes the participant to mosquito-borne pathogens, therefore new exposure-free methods are needed to replace it.                                                                                                                                           Methods: Commercially available electrocuting grids (EGs) were evaluated as an alternative to HLC using a Latin Square experimental design in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Both HLC and EGs were used to estimate the proportion of human exposure to mosquitoes occurring indoors (?i), as well as its two underlying parameters: the proportion of mosquitoes caught indoors (Pi) and the proportion of mosquitoes caught between the first and last hour when most people are indoors (Pfl).                                                                                                                     Results: HLC and EGs methods accounted for 69% and 31% of the total number of female mosquitoes caught respectively and both methods caught more mosquitoes outdoors than indoors. Results from the gold standard HLC suggest that An. gambiae s.s. in Dar es Salaam is neither exophagic nor endophagic (Pi???0.5), whereas An. arabiensis is exophagic (Pi?<?< 0.5). Both species prefer to feed after 10pm when most people are indoors (Pfl >?>?0.5). EGs yielded estimates of Pi for An. gambiae s.s., An. arabiensis and An. coustani, that were approximately equivalent to those with HLC but significantly underestimated Pfl for An. gambiae s.s. and An. coustani. The relative sampling sensitivity of EGs declined over the course of the night (p???0.001) for all mosquito taxa except An. arabiensis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                Conclusions: Commercial EGs sample human-seeking mosquitoes with high sensitivity both indoors and outdoors and accurately measure the propensity of Anopheles malaria vectors to bite indoors rather than outdoors. However, further modifications are needed to stabilize sampling sensitivity over a full nocturnal cycle so that they can be used to survey patterns of human exposure to mosquitoes."

All oils were found to exhibit high mosquito repellency activity against Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto in the laboratory tests with RC50 values ranging from 2.0- to 15-×10?5 mg cm?2, whereas standard N,N-diethyl- 3-toluamide (DEET) was more repelling with RC50 value of 0.1×10?5mg cm?2. The formulation containing 10% of O. gratissimum provided protection against mosquito bites from Anopheles funestus of 70.5 to 95.7%, A. gambiae of 63.2 to 91.5% andCulex quinquefasciatus of 83.8 to 89.5%. The 30% O. gratissimum formulation was more effective with better protection against mosquito bites from A. funestus of 84.2 to 96.6%, A. gambiae of 73.7 to 91.5% and C. quinquefasciatus of 89.5 to 91.5%.

Currently, there is inadequate armory of drugs for the treatment of malaria, trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. This underscores the continuing need for the discovery and development of new anti-protozoal drugs. Consequently, there is an urgent need for research aimed at the discovery and development of new effective and safe anti-plasmodial, anti-trypanosomal and anti-leishmanial drugs. Methods: Bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation was employed for the isolation and purification of antiprotozoal alkaloids. Results: The methanol extract from the leaves of Annickia kummeriae from Tanzania exhibited a strong anti-plasmodial activity against the multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum K1 strain (IC50 0.12 Â± 0.01 Âµg/ml, selectivity index (SI) of 250, moderate activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense STIB 900 strain (IC50 2.50 Â± 0.19 Âµg/ml, SI 12) and mild activity against Leishmania donovani axenic MHOM-ET-67/82 strain (IC50 9.25 Â± 0.54 Âµg/ml, SI 3.2). Bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation led to the isolation of four pure alkaloids, lysicamine (1), trivalvone (2), palmatine (3), jatrorrhizine (4) and two sets of mixtures of jatrorrhizine (4) with columbamine (5) and palmatine (3) with (-)-tetrahydropalmatine (6). The alkaloids showed low cytotoxicity activity (CC50 30 - >90 Âµg/ml), strong to moderate anti-plasmodial activity (IC50 0.08 Â± 0.001 - 2.4 Â± 0.642 Âµg/ml, SI 1.5-1,154), moderate to weak anti-trypanosomal (IC50 2.80 Â± 0.001 - 14.3 Â± 0.001 Âµg/ml, SI 2.3-28.1) and anti-leishmanial activity IC50 2.7 Â± 0.001 - 20.4 Â± 0.003 Âµg/ml, SI 1.7-15.6).

", Evaluation of the long-lasting insecticidal net Interceptor LN: laboratory and experimental hut studies against anopheline and culicine mosquitoes in northeastern Tanzania,anopheline and culicine ,Parasites & Vectors,2013,6,,296,,8,,,,,,,,,"Background: Long lasting insecticidal nets (LN) are a primary method of malaria prevention. Before new types of LN are approved they need to meet quality and efficacy standards set by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme. The process of evaluation has three phases. In Phase I the candidate LN must meet threshold bioassay criteria after 20 standardized washes. In Phase II washed and unwashed LNs are evaluated in experimental huts against wild, free flying anopheline mosquitoes. In Phase III the LN are distributed to households in malaria endemic areas, sampled over three years of use and tested for continuing insecticidal efficacy. Interceptor® LN (BASF Corporation, Germany) is made of polyester netting coated with a wash resistant formulation of alpha-cypermethrin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Methods: Interceptor LN was subjected to bioassay evaluation and then to experimental hut trial against pyrethroid-susceptible Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus and resistant Culex quinquefasciatus. Mosquito mortality, blood feeding inhibition and personal protection were compared between untreated nets, conventional alpha-cypermethrin treated nets (CTN) washed 20 times and LNs washed 0, 20 and 30 times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Results: In Phase I Interceptor LN demonstrated superior wash resistance and efficacy to the CTN. In the Phase II hut trial the LN killed 92% of female An. gambiae when unwashed and 76% when washed 20 times; the CTN washed 20 times killed 44%. The LN out-performed the CTN in personal protection and blood-feeding inhibition. The trend for An. funestus was similar to An. gambiae for all outcomes. Few pyrethroid-resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus were killed and yet the level of personal protection (75-90%) against Culex was similar to that of susceptible An. gambiae (76-80%) even after 20 washes. This protection is relevant because Cx. quinquefasciatus is a vector of lymphatic filariasis in East Africa. After 20 washes and 60 nights’ use the LN retained 27% of its initial insecticide dose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Conclusions: Interceptor LN meets the approval criteria set by WHO and is recommended for use in disease control against East African vectors of malaria and filariasis. Some constraints associated with the phase II evaluation criteria, in particular the washing procedure, are critically reviewed."

It becomes even more challenging when local languages do not have equivalent scientific and technical vocabularies, rendering communication of scientific concepts in translated documents extremely difficult. Even when bilingual lexicons are developed, there is no guarantee that participants understand the terminology as translated.                                                                                 Methods: We conducted twelve focus groups with women of reproductive age in Mwanza, Tanzania to explore the effectiveness of four questioning techniques for: (1) assessing participants' familiarity with existing technical terms and concepts, (2) generating a list of acceptable technical and non-technical terms, (3) testing our definitions of technical terms, and (4) verifying participants' preferences for terms. Focus groups were transcribed, translated, and qualitatively analyzed.                                                                                                           Results and Discussion: A translation process that uses all four questioning techniques in a step-wise approach is an effective way to establish a baseline understanding of participants' familiarity with research terms, to develop and test translatable definitions, and to identify participants' preferred terminology for international HIV clinical research. This may help to ensure that important concepts are not “lost in translation.” The results emphasize the importance of using a variety of techniques depending on the level of participant familiarity with research concepts, the existence of colloquial or technical terms in the target language, and the inherent complexity of the terms."

However these studies are unable to tell us what the overall impact of pregnancy is on HIV acquisition in the general population.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Methods: Data from six community-based HIV cohorts were pooled to give 2,628 sero-conversions and a total of 178,000 person years of observation. Multiple imputation was used to allow for the uncertainty of exact sero-conversion date in surveillance intervals greater than the length of a pregnancy. Results were combined using Rubin’s rules to give appropriate error bounds. The analysis was stratified into two periods: pre- and post- widespread availability of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission services. This allows us to assess whether there is reporting bias relating to a person’s knowledge of their own HIV status which would become more widespread in the latter time period.                                                         Results: Results suggest that women while pregnant have a lower risk of acquiring HIV infection over all periods (HRR 0.79, 95%CI 0.70-0.89) than women who were not pregnant. There is no evidence for a difference in the rate of HIV acquisition between postpartum and non-pregnant women (HRR 0.92 95%CI 0.84-1.03).                                                                                      Discussion: Although there may be immunological reasons for increased risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy, at a population level this study indicates a lower risk of HIV acquisition for pregnant women. Pregnant women may be more likely to be concordant with their current sexual partner than non-pregnant women, i.e. either already HIV positive prior to the pregnancy or if negative at the time of becoming pregnant more likely to have a negative partner."

METHODS: This study was carried out in two hospitals, namely, Tumbi in Coast Region and Dodoma in Dodoma Region. In each facility, hospital records of occupational exposure to HIV infection and its management were reviewed. In addition, practices to prevent occupational exposure to HIV infection among HCWs were observed.                                                                 RESULTS: The estimated risk of HIV transmission due to needle stick injuries was calculated to be 7 cases per 1,000,000 HCWs-years. Over half of the observed hospital departments did not have guidelines for prevention and management of occupational exposure to HIV infections and lacked well displayed health and safety instructions. Approximately, one-fifth of the hospital departments visited failed to adhere to the instructions pertaining to correlation between waste materials and the corresponding colour coded bag/container/safety box. Seventy four percent of the hospital departments observed did not display instructions for handling infectious materials. Inappropriate use of gloves, lack of health and safety instructions, and lack of use of eye protective glasses were more frequently observed at Dodoma Hospital than at Tumbi Hospital.                                                                                 CONCLUSIONS: The poor quality of the hospital records at the two hospitals hampered our effort to characterize the risk of HIV infection acquisition by HCWs. Greater data completeness in hospital records is needed to allow the determination of the actual risk of HIV transmission for HCWs. To further reduce the risk of HIV infection due to occupational exposure, hospitals should be equipped with sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) and HCWs should be reminded of the importance of adhering to universal precautions."

To some degree it is inevitable that HCWs sustain injuries from sharp objects such as needles, scalpels and splintered bone during execution of their duties. However, in Tanzania, there is little or no information on factors that influence the practice of managing occupational exposure to HIV by HCWs. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of self-reported occupational exposure to HIV among HCWs and explore factors that influence the practice of managing occupational exposure to HIV by HCWs in Tanzania. Methods: Self-administered questionnaire was designed to gather information of healthcare workers’ occupational exposures in the past 12 months and circumstances in which these injuries occurred. Practice of managing occupational exposure was assessed by the following questions:  Results: Nearly half of the HCWs had experienced at least one occupational injury in the past 12 months. Though most of the occupational exposures to HIV were experienced by female nurses, non-medical hospital staff received PEP more frequently than nurses and doctors. Doctors and nurses frequently encountered occupational injuries in surgery room and labor room respectively. HCWs with knowledge on the possibility of HIV transmission and those who knew whom to contact in event of occupational exposure to HIV were less likely to have poor practice of managing occupational exposure.  Conclusion: Needle stick injuries and splashes are common among HCWs at Tumbi and Dodoma hospitals. Knowledge of the risk of HIV transmission due to occupational exposure and knowing whom to contact in event of exposure predicted practice of managing the exposure. Thus provision of health education on occupational exposure may strengthen healthcare workers’ practices to manage occupational exposure."

Since the early 1990s, it has been suggested that the two infections may interact and potentiate the effects of each other within co-infected human hosts. Indeed, S. mansoni infection has been suggested to be a risk factor for HIV transmission and progression in Africa. If so, it would follow that mass deworming could have beneficial effects on HIV-1 transmission dynamics. The epidemiology of HIV in African countries is changing, shifting from urban to rural areas where the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni is high and public health services are deficient. On the other side, the consequent pathogenesis of HIV-1/S. mansoni co-infection remains unknown. Here we give an account of the epidemiology of HIV-1 and S. mansoni, discuss co-infection and possible biological causal relationships between the two infections, and the potential impact of praziquantel treatment on HIV-1 viral loads, CD4+ counts and CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Our review of the available literature indicates that there is evidence to support the hypothesis that S. mansoni infections can influence the replication of the HIV-1, cell-to-cell transmission, as well as increase HIV progression as measured by reduced CD4+ T lymphocytes counts.

Population based studies have indicated a decline in overall malaria prevalence among under-fives from 18.1% in 2008 to 9.7% in 2012. The decline of malaria infection has occurred in all geographical zones of the country. Malaria mortality and cumulative probability of deaths have also shown a marked decline from 2000 to 2010. During the same period, area specific studies in Muheza, Korogwe, Muleba and Mvomero have also reported a similar declining trend in malaria prevalence and incidence. The decline in malaria prevalence has been observed to coincide with a decline in transmission indices including anopheline mosquito densities. The decline in malaria prevalence has been attributed to a combination of factors including improved access to effective malaria treatment with artemisinin combination therapy and protection from mosquito bites by increased availability of insecticide treated bednets and indoor residual spraying. The objective of this paper was to review the changing landscape of malaria and its implication for disease management, vector control, and livelihoods in Tanzania. It seeks to examine the links within a broad framework that considers the different pathways given the multiplicity of interactions that can produce unexpected outcomes and trade-offs. Despite the remarkable decline in malaria burden, Tanzania is faced with a number of challenges. These include the development of resistance of malaria vectors to pyrethroids, changing mosquito behaviour and livelihood activities that increase mosquito productivity and exposure to mosquito bites. In addition, there are challenges related to health systems, community perceptions, community involvement and sustainability of funding to the national malaria control programme. This review indicates that malaria remains an important and challenging disease that illustrates the interactions among ecosystems, livelihoods, and health systems. Livelihoods and several sectoral development activities including construction, water resource development and agricultural practices contribute significantly to malaria mosquito productivity and transmission. Consequently, these situations require innovative and integrative re-thinking of the strategies to prevent and control malaria. In conclusion, to accelerate and sustain malaria control in Tanzania, the prevention strategies must go hand in hand with an intersectoral participation approach that takes into account ecosystems and livelihoods that have the potential to increase or decrease malaria transmission."

Compared with infections with the less-mutated haplotypes, infections with the sextuple haplotype mutation were associated with lower (359 g) birthweights. Continued use of the suboptimal IPTp-SP regimen should be reevaluated, and alternative strategies (e.g., intermittent screening and treatment or intermittent treatment with safe and effective alternative drugs) should be evaluated"

It aims to improve adherence to treatment by giving patients the choice of having drug intake supervised at the health facility by a medical professional or at home by a supporter of their choice.                                                         Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in three districts of Tanzania during October 2007, one year after PCT was rolled out nationally. Semi-structured questionnaires were used to assess whether key elements of the PCT approach were being implemented, to evaluate supporters’ knowledge, to capture opinions on factors contributing to treatment completion, and to assess how treatment completion was measured. Transcripts from open-ended responses were analyzed using framework analysis.                                                        Results: Interviews were conducted with 127?TB patients, 107 treatment supporters and 70 health workers. In total, 25.2% of TB patients were not given a choice about the place of treatment by health workers, and only 13.7% of those given a choice reported that they were given adequate time to make their decision. Only 24.3% of treatment supporters confirmed that they were instructed how to complete patients’ treatment cards. Proper health education was the factor most frequently reported by health workers as favoring successful completion of TB treatment (45.7%). The majority of health workers (68.6%) said they checked returned blister packs to verify whether patients had taken their treatment, but only 20.0% checked patients’ treatment cards.

In 2001 Tanzania replaced chloroquine (CQ) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as first-line drug, which in turn was replaced by artemisinin combination therapy in 2006. SP has however, continued to be used in intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) despite reports of high levels of resistance to SP due to the lack of alternatives to SP for IPTp. Recent reports have indicated recovery of CQ-susceptibility in Malawi, Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania based on the prevalence of wild types at codon 76 of the Pfcrt gene in indigenous P. falciparum populations. The current prevalence of this Pfcrt- 76 CQ resistance marker from six regions of Tanzania mainland is hereby reported.                                                                                                                  Methods: DNA extracted from filter-paper dried blood spots and rapid diagnostics kit strips collected from finger-prick blood were used to genotype the Pfcrt-76 resistance marker using PCR-RFLP. Data from previously published studies were used to generate CQ susceptibility recovery trends using logistic regression model.                                                                             Results:Seven hundred and forty one (741) samples were genotyped. The current frequency of the CQ-susceptible Pfcrt-K76 was above 92% and did not differ between regions in Tanzania (? 2?=?2.37; p?=?0.795). The K76 allelic prevalence was between 85.7 and 93% in regions (? 2?=?7.88, p?=?0.163). The CQ resistance recovery trends showed regional variability that may be caused by differences in malaria transmission intensity, but overall the trends converge as the susceptibility levels in all regions approach >90%.                                                            Conclusions: CQ withdrawal in Tanzania has resulted into >90% recovery of susceptibility in ten years of withdrawal. These findings are in support of the search for CQ-based combination drugs as a possible future alternative to SP for IPTp in places where full recovery of CQ-susceptibility will be evident."

At enrolment, women were interviewed to obtain information about alcohol use, using CAGE and AUDIT screening scales, and risk factors for HIV infection. Blood and genital samples were collected for detection of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We characterized alcohol use, concordance, and agreement of the scales, and examined the associations between characteristics of participants and problem drinking as defined by both scales using logistic regression. Lastly, we assessed problem drinking as a risk factor for recent sexual behavior and prevalent STIs.            RESULTS:Among enrollees, 68% women reported ever drinking alcohol; of these 76% reported drinking alcohol in the past 12 months.

The World Health Organization recommends that only facilities equipped with available trained staff, capable to perform at least minor surgery, able to offer minimum MC package and appropriate equipment for resuscitation, and compliant with requirements for sterilization and infection control should be allowed to deliver safe circumcision services. A cross-sectional study using quantitative data collection technique was conducted to assess the readiness of the health facilities to deliver safe circumcision services in selected districts of Tanzania. All hospitals, health centres and 30% of all dispensaries in these districts were selected to participate in the study. Face-to-face questionnaires were administered to the heads of the health facilities and to health practitioners. Overall, 49/69 (59%) of the facilities visited provided circumcision services and only 46/203 (24%) of the health practitioners performed circumcision procedures. These were mainly assistant medical officers and clinical officers. The vast majority – 190/203 (95%) – of the health practitioners require additional training prior to providing circumcision services. Most facilities – 63/69 (91%) – had all basic supplies (gloves, basin, chlorine and waste disposal) necessary for infection prevention, 44/69 (65%) provided condoms, HIV counselling and testing, and sexually-transmitted infections services, while 62/69 (90%) had the capability to perform at least minor surgery. However, only 25/69 (36%) and 15/69 (22%) of the facilities had functioning sterilization equipment and appropriate resuscitation equipment, respectively. There is readiness for roll out of circumcision services; however, more practitioners need to be trained on circumcision procedures, demand forecasting.

Active case detection often relying on rapid diagnostic tests for mass screen and treat campaigns has been proposed as a method to detect and treat individuals in hotspots. Data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in north-western Tanzania were used to examine the spatial distribution of Plasmodium falciparum and the relationship between household exposure and parasite density. Dried blood spots were collected from consenting individuals from four villages during a survey conducted in 2010. These were analysed by PCR for the presence of P. falciparum, with the parasite density of positive samples being estimated by quantitative PCR. Household exposure was estimated using the distance-weighted PCR prevalence of infection. Parasite density simulations were used to estimate the proportion of infections that would be treated using a screen and treat approach with rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) compared to targeted mass drug administration (tMDA) and Mass Drug Administration (MDA). Polymerase chain reaction PCR analysis revealed that of the 3,057 blood samples analysed, 1,078 were positive. Mean distance-weighted PCR prevalence per household was 34.5%. Parasite density was negatively associated with transmission intensity with the odds of an infection being subpatent increasing with household exposure (OR 1.09 per 1% increase in exposure). Parasite density was also related to age, being highest in children five to ten years old and lowest in those >?40 years. Simulations of different tMDA strategies showed that treating all individuals in households where RDT prevalence was above 20% increased the number of infections that would have been treated from 43 to 55%. However, even with this strategy, 45% of infections remained untreated. The negative relationship between household exposure and parasite density suggests that DNA-based detection of parasites is needed to provide adequate sensitivity in hotspots. Targeting MDA only to households with RDT-positive individuals may allow a larger fraction of infections to be treated. These results suggest that community-wide MDA, instead of screen and treat strategies, may be needed to successfully treat the asymptomatic, subpatent parasite reservoir and reduce transmission in similar settings"

Methods: The study was conducted in Mkuranga and Mufindi districts. Data were collected between November 2005 and December 2007, involving focus group discussion (FGD) with Mufindi CHMT and in-depth interviews were conducted with few CHMT members in Mkuranga where it was difficult to summon all members for FGD.                                                             Results: Participants in both districts acknowledged the IPTp strategy, considering the seriousness of malaria in pregnancy problem; government allocation of funds to support healthcare staff training programmes in focused antenatal care (fANC) issues, procuring essential drugs distributed to districts, staff remuneration, distribution of fANC guidelines, and administrative activities performed by CHMTs. The identified weaknesses include late arrival of funds from central level weakening CHMT’s performance in health supervision, organising outreach clinics, distributing essential supplies, and delivery of IPTp services. Participants anticipated the public losing confidence in SP for IPTp after government announced artemither-lumefantrine (ALu) as the new first-line drug for uncomplicated malaria replacing SP. Role of private healthcare staff in IPTp services was acknowledged cautiously because CHMTs rarely supplied private clinics with SP for free delivery in fear that clients would be required to pay for the SP contrary to government policy. In Mufindi, the District Council showed a strong political support by supplementing ANC clinics with bottled water; in Mkuranga such support was not experienced. A combination of health facility understaffing, water scarcity and staff non-adherence to directly observed therapy instructions forced healthcare staff to allow clients to take SP at home. Need for investigating in improving adherence to IPTp administration was emphasised.

Recent reports have indicated recovery of CQ-susceptibility in Malawi, Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania based on the prevalence of wild types at codon 76 of the Pfcrt gene in indigenous P. falciparum populations. The current prevalence of this Pfcrt- 76 CQ resistance marker from six regions of Tanzania mainland is hereby reported.                                                                                                                     Methods: DNA extracted from filter-paper dried blood spots and rapid diagnostics kit strips collected from finger-prick blood were used to genotype the Pfcrt-76 resistance marker using PCR-RFLP. Data from previously published studies were used to generate CQ susceptibility recovery trends using logistic regression model.                                                                             Results: Seven hundred and forty one (741) samples were genotyped. The current frequency of the CQ-susceptible Pfcrt-K76 was above 92% and did not differ between regions in Tanzania (? 2?=?2.37; p?=?0.795). The K76 allelic prevalence was between 85.7 and 93% in regions (? 2?=?7.88, p?=?0.163). The CQ resistance recovery trends showed regional variability that may be caused by differences in malaria transmission intensity, but overall the trends converge as the susceptibility levels in all regions approach >90%.                                                           Conclusions: CQ withdrawal in Tanzania has resulted into >90% recovery of susceptibility in ten years of withdrawal. These findings are in support of the search for CQ-based combination drugs as a possible future alternative to SP for IPTp in places where full recovery of CQ-susceptibility will be evident"

"," Urban lymphatic filariasis in the metropolis of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania",lymphatic filariasis, Parasites & Vectors,2013,6,,286,,5,,,,,,,,,"Background: The last decades have seen a considerable increase in urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa, and it is estimated that over 50% of the population will live in urban areas by 2040. Rapid growth of cities combined with limited economic resources often result in informal settlements and slums with favorable conditions for proliferation of vectors of lymphatic filariasis (LF). In Dar es Salaam, which has grown more than 30 times in population during the past 55 years (4.4 million inhabitants in 2012), previous surveys have indicated high prevalences of LF. This study investigated epidemiological aspects of LF in Dar es Salaam, as a background for planning and implementation of control.                                    Methods: Six sites with varying distance from the city center (3–30 km) and covering different population densities, socioeconomic characteristics, and water, sewerage and sanitary facilities were selected for the study. Pupils from one public primary school at each site were screened for circulating filarial antigen (CFA; marker of adult worm infection) and antibodies to Bm14 (marker of exposure to transmission). Community members were examined for CFA, microfilariae and chronic manifestations. Structured questionnaires were administered to pupils and heads of community households, and vector surveys were carried out in selected households.                                                                                                              Results: The study indicated that a tremendous decrease in the burden of LF infection had occurred, despite haphazard urbanisation. Contributing factors may be urban malaria control targeting Anopheles vectors, short survival time of the numerous Culex quinquefasciatus vectors in the urban environment, widespread use of bed nets and other mosquito proofing measures, and mass drug administration (MDA) in 2006 and 2007. Although the level of ongoing transmission was low, the burden of chronic LF disease was still high                       Conclusions: The development has so far been promising, but continued efforts are necessary to ensure elimination of LF as a public health problem. These will include improving the awareness of people about the role of mosquitoes in transmission of LF, more thorough implementation of environmental sanitation to reduce Cx. quinquefasciatus breeding, continued MDA to high-risk areas, and set-up of programmes for management of chronic LF disease."

This is partly because the control strategies developed for rural areas - where most LF occurs - do not easily comply with human organization and behaviour in urban areas, and partly because the urban vectors thrive and proliferate in poorly planned urban settlements. This study investigated LF infection, disease and transmission in the medium-sized city of Tanga (approx. 300,000 inhabitants), Tanzania, after seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA). Three representative sites with varying distance from the city centre were selected for the study. Pupils from one public primary school at each site were screened for circulating filarial antigens (CFA; marker of adult worm infection) and antibodies to Bm14 (marker of exposure to transmission). Community members were examined for CFA, microfilariae and chronic manifestations. Questionnaires were administered to pupils and heads of community households, and vector surveys were carried out in selected households. Although there was evidence of considerable reduction in infection and transmission, there was still LF in the city, with mf and CFA prevalences well above the cut-off levels for stopping MDA. In this respect, the LF situation resembled that seen in nearby rural areas outside the city. The study emphasizes the importance of motivating the urban individuals to engage and comply with the full range of LF intervention measures (MDAs, use of mosquito proofing measures including bed nets, environmental sanitation to prevent vector breeding) in order to reach successful LF control in the city. The high LF disease burden noted, despite the reduction in infection and transmission, moreover emphasizes the importance of allocating resources for morbidity management, to ensure true elimination of LF as a public health problem."

A study on schistosomiasis-related perceptions and water contact behaviour was undertaken in one community population of Hamuyebe village in Ukerewe district, north-western Tanzania, where intestinal schistosomiasis is endemic before and 2 years after implementation of a participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) intervention. Data were obtained from baseline and post-intervention knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) questionnaire surveys conducted between 2008 and 2010 among 157 individuals aged 15 years and above. The surveys were further complemented by structured observations of human–water contact activities. We found significant increases in respondents’ knowledge of the cause, transmission, symptoms and health consequences of schistosomiasis after the intervention. The reported treatment seeking and preventive practices were congruous with the actual (observed) behaviour. Frequency, duration and timing of water contacts also decreased significantly after the intervention and took into consideration the fact that those activities which need larger body surface exposure, for a long period and at an appropriate time when cercarial densities are high (i.e. around noon) are important for the transmission of schistosomiasis. We conclude that PHAST intervention has succeeded in effecting positive changes in peoples’ perceptions and attitudes towards water. As a result, knowledge obtained from the said intervention was translated into actions to prevent schistosomiasis. Studies on knowledge, attitudes and practices coupled with structured observations should be part of the integrated approach for the control of schistosomiasis."

The use of household asset data to determine wealth indices is a common procedure for estimating socio-economic position in low-income countries. Indeed, in such settings information about income is usually lacking and the collection of individual consumption or expenditure data would require in-depth interviews, posing a considerable risk of bias. In this study, we determined the socio-economic status of 159 households in a village in north-western Tanzania before and 1 year after participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) intervention to control schistosomiasis. We constructed a household 'wealth index' based on durable assets ownership (e.g. bicycle and radio) and household characteristics dealing with ownership of land and house construction features (e.g. type of walls and roof). We employed principal components analysis and classified households into wealth quintiles. The study revealed that asset variables with positive factor scores were associated with higher socio-economic status, whereas asset variables with negative factor scores were associated with lower socio-economic status. Overall, households which were rated as the poorest and very poor were on the decrease, whereas those rated as poor, less poor and the least poor were on the increase after PHAST intervention. This decrease/increase was significant. The median shifted from -0.761 to -0.448, and the mean from -0.204 (standard deviation (SD) 1.924) to 0.193 (SD 2.079) between pre- and post-intervention phases. The difference in socio-economic status of the people comparing the pre- and post-intervention phases was highly statistically significant (p<0.001). This observation was confirmed by a multinomial model with a random effect on the households. We argue that significant changes in the socio-economic status observed in our study are attributable to the PHAST intervention, despite other sporadic interventions against schistosomiasis."

Methods: Diverse ecological niche modelling techniques have been developed for this purpose: we present a maximum entropy (Maxent) approach for estimating distributions of potential RVF vectors in un-sampled areas in East Africa. We modelled the distribution of two species of mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens complex) responsible for potential maintenance and amplification of the virus, respectively.

Model performance was statistically significantly better than random for both species. Most suitable sites for the two vectors were predicted in central and northwestern Tanzania with previous disease epidemics. Other important risk areas include western Lake Victoria, northern parts of Lake Malawi, and the Rift Valley region of Kenya.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis suggested an optimal cutoff for admission blood sugar of < 5 mmol/L in predicting mortality (sensitivity = 57.7%, specificity = 75.2%). A cutoff for admission blood glucose of < 5 mmol/L represents a simple and clinically useful predictor of mortality in children admitted with severe febrile illness to hospital in resource-poor settings."

We examined factors associated with subtype using multinomial logistic regression, adjusted for study, age, and sex.                                                                                  Results: Among 140 individuals (125 women and 15 men), subtype A1 predominated (54, 39%), followed by C (46, 33%), D (25, 18%) and unique recombinant forms (URFs) (15, 11%). There was weak evidence to suggest different subtype frequencies by study (for example, 18% URFs in the Kisesa cohort versus 5–9% in the hospitality facility-worker cohorts; adjusted relative-risk ratio (aRR)?=?2.35 [95% CI 0.59,9.32]; global p?=?0.09). Compared to men, women were less likely to have subtype D versus A (aRR?=?0.12 [95% CI 0.02,0.76]; global p?=?0.05). There was a trend to suggest lower relative risk of subtype D compared to A with older age (aRR?=?0.44 [95% CI 0.23,0.85] per 10 years; global p?=?0.05).                                                                  Conclusions: We observed multiple subtypes, confirming the complex genetic diversity of HIV-1 strains circulating in northern Tanzania, and found some differences between cohorts and by age and sex. This has important implications for vaccine design and development, providing opportunity to determine vaccine efficacy in diverse HIV-1 strains."

The widespread adoption of the syndromic approach to the diagnosis and management of sexually transmitted infections has also meant that the collection of a genital specimen for laboratory analysis is no longer routinely done when patients present with genital complaints, and clinical staff and laboratory technicians have lost the skill to collect genital specimens and processing them for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Following reports of gonococcal antimicrobial resistance to quinolones, WHO urged countries to monitor gonococcal antimicrobial resistance in a more systematic and regular manner. Although the response in Africa has been slow to take off, a number of studies have been conducted in a few countries and plans for implementation are in place in others. However, the number of isolates studied has been small in nearly all the countries except one, and the barriers to scaling up gonococcal antimicrobial resistance surveys seem overwhelming. In spite of the studies being few and of small sample sizes, enough information can be discerned to indicate that quinolones can no longer be a medicine of choice for the treatment of gonorrhoea in Africa and the threat of antimicrobial resistance developing in Neisseria gonorrhoeae to third-generation cephalosporins is real and imminent."

Most vector control programmes aiming at controlling life-threatening mosquitoes rely on the use of chemical insecticides, mainly belonging to the pyrethroid class. However, resistance of mosquito populations to pyrethroids is increasing at a dramatic rate, threatening the efficacy of control programmes throughout insecticide-treated areas, where mosquito-borne diseases are still prevalent. In the absence of new insecticides and efficient alternative vector control methods, resistance management strategies are therefore critical, but these require a deep understanding of adaptive mechanisms underlying resistance. Although insecticide resistance mechanisms are intensively studied in mosquitoes, such adaptation is often considered as the unique result of the selection pressure caused by insecticides used for vector control. Indeed, additional environmental parameters, such as insecticides/pesticides usage in agriculture, the presence of anthropogenic or natural xenobiotics, and biotic interactions between vectors and other organisms, may affect both the overall mosquito responses to pyrethroids and the selection of resistance mechanisms. In this context, the present work aims at updating current knowledge on pyrethroid resistance mechanisms in mosquitoes and compiling available data, often from different research fields, on the impact of the environment on mosquito response to pyrethroids. Key environmental factors, such as the presence of urban or agricultural pollutants and biotic interactions between mosquitoes and their microbiome are discussed, and research perspectives to fill in knowledge gaps are suggested."

Epub 25 Jan 2013,,,,,,,,"The East African Integrated Disease Surveillance Network (EAIDSNet) was formed in response to a growing frequency of cross-border malaria outbreaks in the 1990s and a growing recognition that fragmented disease interventions, coupled with weak laboratory capacity, were making it difficult to respond in a timely manner to the outbreaks of malaria and other infectious diseases. The East Africa Community (EAC) partner states, with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation, established EAIDSNet in 2000 to develop and strengthen the communication channels necessary for integrated cross-border disease surveillance and control efforts. The objective of this paper is to review the regional EAIDSNet initiative and highlight achievements and challenges in its implementation. Major accomplishments of EAIDSNet include influencing the establishment of a Department of Health within the EAC Secretariat to support a regional health agenda; successfully completing a regional field simulation exercise in pandemic influenza preparedness; and piloting a web-based portal for linking animal and human health disease surveillance. The strategic direction of EAIDSNet was shaped, in part, by lessons learned following a visit to the more established Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS) regional network. Looking to the future, EAIDSNet is collaborating with the East, Central and Southern Africa Health Community (ECSA-HC), EAC partner states, and the World Health Organization to implement the World Bank-funded East Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking Project (EAPHLNP). The network has also begun lobbying East African countries for funding to support EAIDSNet activities."

This study aimed to determine factors associated with body composition at commencement of TB treatment in Mwanza, Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 2007 to 2008 among newly diagnosed TB patients. Fat and fat-free mass were determined using a deuterium dilution technique and fat and fat-free mass indices were computed. Correlates were assessed using multiple regression analysis. A total of 201 pulmonary TB patients were recruited; of these, 37.8% (76) were female, 51.7% (104) were HIV infected, 65.3% (126) had sputum-positive TB, and 24.4% (49) were current smokers. In multiple regressions analysis, males had a 2.2-kg/m(2) [(95% CI = 1.6, 2.9); P < 0.0001] lower fat mass index but 1.5 kg/m(2) [(95% CI = 0.9, 2.0); P < 0.0001] higher fat-free mass index compared with females.

The main threat to effective malaria control is the selection of insecticide resistance. While resistance to pyrethroids, the primary insecticide used for LLINs and IRS, has been reported among mosquito vectors in only a few sites in Tanzania, neighbouring East African countries are recording increasing levels of resistance. To monitor the rapidly evolving situation, the resistance status of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae s.l to different insecticides and the prevalence of the kdr resistance allele involved in pyrethroid resistance were investigated in north-western Tanzania, an area that has been subject to several rounds of pyrethroid IRS since 2006. Household collections of anopheline mosquitoes were exposed to diagnostic dosages of pyrethroid, DDT, and bendiocarb using WHO resistance test kits. The relative proportions of An. gambiae s.s and Anopheles arabiensis were also investigated among mosquitoes sampled using indoor CDC light traps. Anophelines were identified to species and the kdr mutation was detected using real time PCR TaqMan assays. From the light trap collections 80% of An. gambiae s.l were identified as An. gambiae s.s and 20% as An. arabiensis. There was cross-resistance between pyrethroids and DDT with mortality no higher than 40% reported in any of the resistance tests. The kdr-eastern variant was present in homozygous form in 97% of An. gambiae s.s but was absent in An. arabiensis. Anopheles gambiae s.s showed reduced susceptibility to the carbamate insecticide, bendiocarb, the proportion surviving WHO tests ranging from 0% to 30% depending on season and location. Anopheles gambiae s.s has developed phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids and DDT and kdr frequency has almost reached fixation. Unlike in coastal Tanzania, where the ratio of An. gambiae s.s to An. arabiensis has decreased in response to vector control, An. gambiae s.s persists at high frequency in north-western Tanzania, probably due to selection of pyrethroid resistance, and this trend is likely to arise in other areas as resistance spreads or is subject to local selection from IRS or LLINs."

Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were undertaken with 124 study participants, study staff and health workers. Participants' understanding of the study's research aims was limited, but the practice of participation – engaging with research staff and materials – appeared to facilitate interpretations of the study's value, conceptualised as a ‘service’. For those peripheral to the study, however, interpretations of it reflected existing suspicions of experimental research. Our findings indicate the importance of considering the expectations, roles and responsibilities constructed through the practice of participation in different types of research, and how they relate to legacies of research. Understanding how networks of research practice intersect local social and historical contexts can extend discussions of collaboration and engagement with research in low-resource settings."

DESIGN: Ninety-three sputum samples collected from 18 tuberculosis patients were decontaminated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide using MGIT™ 960 and in STC-NRA cultures, both in the presence and in the absence of PNB, an inhibitor of MTC growth. The reduction of STC by colour change indicated mycobacterial growth; NRA was then performed to confirm MTC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    RESULTS:STC-NRA culture was positive for acid-fast bacilli in 66/93 (71%) samples, of which 60/93 (64.5%) were identified as MTC-positive and 6/93 (6.5%) as indeterminate mycobacteria. MGIT indicated MTC in 59/93 (63.4%) cultures. Contamination was detected in 12/93 (13%) STC-NRA cultures vs. 29/93 (31.2%) MGIT cultures. The mean time to detection (TTD) of MTC using STC-NRA was 14 days and 7 days using MGIT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               CONCLUSION:The STC-NRA method is sensitive for the detection of MTC in sputum. TTD increased with duration of anti-tuberculosis treatment, highlighting the value of this method in monitoring treatment success. The method is simple and inexpensive and, unlike MGIT, does not require technical equipment. The preliminary performance characteristics of the method should be further evaluated in larger studies."

DSS collects longitudinal data on migration, births, deaths and their causes via verbal autopsies. DSS data provide an opportunity to monitor many health indicators including mortality trends. Mortality rates in Sub-Sahara Africa show seasonal patterns due to high infant and child malaria-related mortality which is influenced by seasonal features present in environmental and climatic factors. However, it is unclear whether seasonal patterns differ by age in the first few months of life. This study provides an overview of approaches to assess, capture and detect seasonality peaks and patterns in mortality using the infant mortality data from the Rufiji DSS, Tanzania. Seasonality was best captured using Bayesian negative binomial models with time and cycle dependent seasonal parameters and autoregressive temporal error terms. Seasonal patterns are similar among different age groups during infancy and timing of their mortality peaks do not differ. Seasonality in mortality rates with two peaks per year is pronounced which corresponds to rainy seasons. Understanding of these trends is important for public health preparedness."

A total of 148 DNA samples from children aged between 3 and 15 years with mild and severe malaria were retrieved and determined by polymerase chain reaction. Children with Glutathione-S-transferase-pi1 (GSTP1)-polymorphism were observed to have three fold risk (OR = 2.9; 95% CI =1.3- 6.1; P = 0.006) of developing severe malaria compared to mild malaria in Mnyuzi in Korogwe District, north- eastern, Tanzania. In the presence of Glutathione-S-transferase-pi1 polymorphism, children were found to have 3% decreased protective effect of alpha+-thalassaemia polymorphisms (homozygotes and heterozygotes) against severe malaria although this was not statistically significant [OR =0.81 (95% CI = 0.5-1.5; P = 0.5) to OR =0.78(95% CI = 0.4-1.5; P = 0.44)].

Birth weight and fetal weight were converted to z-scores, and fetal growth evaluated as fetal weight gain from the 26th week of pregnancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Results: Malaria infection only affected birth weight and fetal growth among primi- and secundigravid women. Forty-eight of the 398 primi- and secundigravid women had malaria during pregnancy causing a reduction in the newborns z-score of ?0.50 (95% CI: ?0.86, ?0.13, P?=?0.008, multiple linear regression). Fifty-eight percent (28/48) of the primi- and secundigravidae had malaria in the first half of pregnancy, but an effect on fetal growth was observed in the 3rd trimester with an OR of 4.89 for the fetal growth rate belonging to the lowest 25% in the population (95%CI: 2.03–11.79, P<0.001, multiple logistic regression). At an individual level, among the primi- and secundigravidae, 27% experienced alterations of fetal growth immediately after exposure but only for a short interval, 27% only late in pregnancy, 16.2% persistently from exposure until the end of pregnancy, and 29.7% had no alterations of fetal growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Conclusions: The effect of malaria infections was observed during the 3rd trimester, despite infections occurring much earlier in pregnancy, and different mechanisms might operate leading to different patterns of growth alterations. This study highlights the need for protection against malaria throughout pregnancy and the recognition that observed changes in fetal growth might be a consequence of an infection much earlier in pregnancy."

As a result, districts were given authority to undertake local planning and set priorities as well as allocate resources fairly to promote the health of a population with varied needs. Nevertheless, priority setting in the health care service has remained a challenge. The study assessed the priority setting processes in the planning of the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programme at the district level in Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted in Mbarali district, south-western Tanzania. The study applied in-depth interviews and focus group discussions in the data collection. Informants included members of the Council Health Management Team, regional PMTCT managers and health facility providers.                                                                                                  RESULTS: Two plans were reported where PMTCT activities could be accommodated; the Comprehensive Council Health Plan and the Regional PMTCT Plan that was donor funded. As donors had their own globally defined priorities, it proved difficult for district and regional managers to accommodate locally defined PMTCT priorities in these plans. As a result few of these were funded. Guidelines and main priority areas of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) also impacted on the ability of the districts and regions to act, undermining the effectiveness of the decentralisation policy in the health sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                  CONCLUSION:The challenges in the priority setting processes revealed within the PMTCT initiative indicate substantial weaknesses in implementing the Tanzania decentralisation policy. There is an urgent need to revive the strategies and aims of the decentralisation policy at all levels of the health care system with a view to improving health service delivery."

We present findings from a detailed study on the effect of six rounds of MDA with this drug combination as implemented by the National Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programme (NLFEP) in a highly endemic rural area of north-eastern Tanzania.                                                                                                                         METHODS:The effect of treatment on transmission and human infection was monitored in a community- and a school-based study during an 8-year period (one pre-intervention and 7 post-intervention years) from 2003 to 2011.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   RESULTS:Before intervention, 24.5% of the community population had microfilariae (mf) in the blood, 53.3% had circulating filarial antigens (CFA) and 78.9% had specific antibodies to the recombinant filarial antigen Bm14. One year after the sixth MDA, these values had decreased considerably to 2.7%, 19.6% and 27.5%, respectively. During the same period, the CFA prevalence among new intakes of Standard 1 pupils in 10 primary schools decreased from 25.2% to 5.6%. In line with this, transmission by the three vectors (Anopheles gambiae, An. funestus and Culex quinquefasciatus) as determined by dissection declined sharply (overall vector infectivity rate by 99.3% and mean monthly transmission potential by 99.2% between pre-intervention and fifth post-intervention period). A major shift in vector species composition, from predominantly anopheline to almost exclusively culicine was observed over the years. This may be largely unrelated to the MDAs but may have important implications for the epidemiology of LF in the area.                                                                                                CONCLUSIONS: Six MDAs caused considerable decrease in all the measured indices for transmission and human infection. In spite of this, indices were still relatively high in the late period of the study, and it may take a long time to reach the recommended cut-off levels for interruption of transmission unless extra efforts are made. These should include increased engagement of the target population in the control activities, to ensure higher treatment coverage. It is expected that the recent initiative to distribute insecticide impregnated bed nets to every household in the area will also contribute towards reaching the goal of successful LF elimination"

The disease may exist in non-clinical form in apparently health animals. This study was designed to investigate the existence and spatial distribution of non-clinical form of RVF virus (RVFV) activity in wild and domestic animals in six districts in northern Tanzania. A retrospective cross-sectional study involved testing a total of 285 and 100 serum samples from domestic ruminants and wildlife species, respectively. The samples were subjected to IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as well as to the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Based on ELISA test, the  seroprevalence of RVF-specific IgG antibodies was: African buffalo (40.9%, n=22), African elephant (33.3%, n=3), cattle (11.8%, n=93), sheep (11.3%, n=97) and goats (8.4%, n=95). Two serum samples from goats tested positive for IgM. All samples tested were RVFV-negative based on RT-PCR test. The highest intravillage sero-prevalence of IgG was observed in two villages (Kimotorok and Lormorije) of Simanjiro district. Domestic ruminants from herds that were located at an elevation below 1000m were at higher risk (OR=2.32, 95% CI 1.05 – 5.16, p=0.04) of RVFV infection. Findings of the current study indicate existence of a wide range of  domestic and wildlife hosts which could serve as potential reservoirs of RVFV during inter-epidemic period. This calls for adoption of one health approach in responding to RVF epidemics as well as during implementation of RVF controlling measures with the ultimate goal of eradicating RVF in Tanzania."

A study was performed in ten health centres in Tanzania, to implement the use of dried blood spots (DBS) as an EQA method for HIV and syphilis (POCTs).                                                                  METHOD:DBS samples were collected for retesting at a reference laboratory and the results compared to the POCT results obtained at the clinic. In total, 2341 DBS samples were collected from 10 rural health facilities over a period of nine months, of which 92.5% were correctly collected and spotted.                                                                                                              RESULTS: The EQA method was easily implemented by healthcare workers under routine conditions in Northern Tanzania. For HIV, 967 out of 972 samples (99.5%) were concordant between DBS and POCT results. For syphilis, the sensitivity of syphilis tests varied between clinics with a median of 96% (25th and 75th quartile; 95-98%). The specificity of syphilis POCT was consistent compared to laboratory based test using DBS, with a median of 96% (25th and 75th quartiles; 95-98%).                                                                                             CONCLUSION: Overall, the quality of testing varied at clinics and EQA results can be used to identify clinics where healthcare workers require remedial training, suggesting the necessity for stringent quality assurance programmes for POC testing. As Tanzania embarks on scaling up HIV and syphilis testing, DBS can be a useful and robust tool to monitor the quality of testing performed by healthcare workers and trigger corrective action to ensure accuracy of test results."

This study investigates how prior experience of HIV and VCT, and knowledge about HIV and ART influence VCT use in rural Tanzania.                                                                                         Methods: In 2006–7, VCT was offered to study participants during the fifth survey round of an HIV community cohort study that includes HIV testing for research purposes without results disclosure, and a questionnaire covering knowledge, attitudes and practices around HIV infection and HIV services. Categorical variables were created for HIV knowledge and ART knowledge, with “good” HIV and ART knowledge defined as correctly answering at least 4/6 and 5/7 questions about HIV and ART respectively. Experience of HIV was defined as knowing people living with HIV, or having died from AIDS. Logistic regression methods were used to assess how HIV and ART knowledge, and prior experiences of HIV and VCT were associated with VCT uptake, with adjustment for HIV status and socio-demographic confounders.                                                                                                                                                                  Results: 2,695/3,886 (69%) men and 2,708/5,575 women (49%) had “good” HIV knowledge, while 613/3,886 (16%) men and 585/5575 (10%) women had “good” ART knowledge. Misconceptions about HIV transmission were common, including through kissing (55% of women, 43% of men), or mosquito bites (42% of women, 34% of men). 19% of men and 16% of women used VCT during the survey. After controlling for HIV status and socio-demographic factors, the odds of VCT use were lower among those with poor HIV knowledge (aOR?=?0.5; p?=?0.01 for men and aOR?=?0.6; p?<?0.01 for women) and poor ART knowledge (aOR?=?0.8; p?=?0.06 for men, aOR?=?0.8; p?<?0.01 for women), and higher among those with HIV experience (aOR?=?1.3 for men and aOR?=?1.6 for women, p?<?0.01) and positive prior VCT experience (aOR?=?2.0 for all men and aOR?=?2.0 for HIV-negative women only, p?<?0.001).           Conclusions: Two years after the introduction of free ART in this setting, misconceptions regarding HIV transmission remain rife and knowledge regarding treatment is worryingly poor, especially among women and HIV-positive people. Further HIV-related information, education and communication activities are urgently needed to improve VCT uptake in rural Tanzania."

Seropositivity rates and corresponding geometric mean titers (GMTs) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           RESULTS: In the according-to-protocol analysis at month 7, 100% of initially seronegative participants in the vaccine group were seropositive for both anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 antibodies (n = 130 and n = 128 for 10-14-year-olds, respectively; n = 190 and n = 212 for 15-25-year-olds). GMTs for HPV-16 and HPV-18 were higher in 10-14-year-olds (18 423 [95% confidence interval, 16 185-20 970] and 6487 [5590-7529] enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU)/mL, respectively) than in 15-25-year-olds (10 683 [9567-11 930] and 3743 [3400-4120] EU/mL, respectively). Seropositivity was maintained at month 12. No participant withdrew owing to adverse events. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CONCLUSIONS: The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine was highly immunogenic and had a clinically acceptable safety profile when administered to healthy HIV-seronegative African girls and young women."

Sequestration is mediated by specific interactions between members of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family and receptors on the endothelial lining. Severe childhood malaria is associated with expression of specific PfEMP1 subtypes containing domain cassettes (DCs) 8 and 13 (ref. 3), but the endothelial receptor for parasites expressing these proteins was unknown. Here we identify endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which mediates the cytoprotective effects of activated protein C, as the endothelial receptor for DC8 and DC13 PfEMP1. We show that EPCR binding is mediated through the amino-terminal cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR?1) of DC8 and group A PfEMP1 subfamilies, and that CIDR?1 interferes with protein C binding to EPCR. This PfEMP1 adhesive property links P. falciparum cytoadhesion to a host receptor involved in anticoagulation and endothelial cytoprotective pathways, and has implications for understanding malaria pathology and the development of new malaria interventions."

Critics question policy recommending involvement of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in emergency obstetric care (EmoC) services in developing countries.          Objectives: This paper reports about knowledge and practices of TBAs on EmoC in Kigoma Rural District, Tanzania and discusses policy implications on involving TBAs in maternal health services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Methods: 157 TBAs were identified from several villages in 2005, interviewed and observed on their knowledge and practice in relation to EmoC. Quantitative and qualitative techniques were used for data collection and analysis depending on the nature of the information required.                                                                                                                                                       Findings: Among all 157 TBAs approached, 57.3% were aged 50+ years while 50% had no formal education. Assisting mothers to deliver without taking their full pregnancy history was confessed by 11% of all respondents. Having been attending pregnant women with complications was experienced by 71.2% of all respondents. Only 58% expressed adequate knowledge on symptoms and signs of pregnancy complications. Lack of knowledge on possible risk of HIV infections while assisting childbirth without taking protective gears was claimed by 5.7% of the respondents. Sharing the same pair of gloves between successful deliveries was reported to be a common practice by 21.1% of the respondents. Use of unsafe delivery materials including local herbs and pieces of cloth for protecting themselves against HIV infections was reported as being commonly practiced among 27.6% of the respondents. Vaginal examination before and during delivery was done by only a few respondents.                                                                                                                                                                                           Conclusion: TBAs in Tanzania are still consulted by people living in underserved areas. Unfortunately, TBAs’ inadequate knowledge on EmOC issues seems to have contributed to the rising concerns about their competence to deliver the recommended maternal services. Thus, the authorities seeming to recognize and promote TBAs should provide support to TBAs in relation to necessary training and giving them essential working facilities, routine supportive supervision and rewarding those seeming to comply with the standard guidelines for delivering EmoC services."

RESULTS: In total 334 participants were enrolled; 221 and 113 in vaccine and control arms, respectively. At enrolment, 74% of 142 sexually active subjects had HPV infection of whom 69% had >1 genotype. Prevalent infections were HPV-45 (16%), HPV-53 (14%), HPV-16 (13%) and HPV-58 (13%). Only age was associated with prevalent HPV infection at enrolment. Among 23 girls who reported age at first sex as 1 year younger than their current age, 15 (65.2%) had HPV infection. Of 187 genotype-specific infections at enrolment, 51 (27%) were present at 12 months. Overall, 67% of 97 sexually active participants with results at enrolment and 12 months had a new HPV genotype at follow-up. Among HPV uninfected female subjects at enrolment, the incidence of any HPV infection was 76 per 100 person-years.

The geographical range of this parasite relies on the distribution of certain species of freshwater pulmonate snails of the genus Biomphalaria. Whilst S. mansoni is known to exhibit high population diversity the true extent of this diversity is still to be fully elucidated as sampling of this taxon progressively accrues. Here a DNA 'barcoding' approach is taken using sequence analysis of a 450bp region within the mitochondrial cox1 gene to assess the genetic diversity within a large number of S. mansoni larval stages collected from their natural human hosts across sub-Saharan Africa. Five hundred and sixty one individual parasite samples were examined from 22 localities and 14 countries. Considerable within-species diversity was found with 120 unique haplotypes splitting geographically into five discrete lineages. The highest diversity was found in East Africa with samples forming three of the five lineages. Less diversity was found in the Far and Central Western regions of Africa with haplotypes from the New World showing a close affinity to the Far Western African S. mansoni populations supporting the hypothesis of a colonisation of South America via the West African slave trade. The data are discussed in relation to parasite diversity and disease epidemiology."

Trial harm and tolerability assessments rely, in part, on participants’ reports of medical histories, adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medications. Optimal methods for questioning participants are unclear, but different methods giving different results can undermine meta-analyses. This study compared methods for eliciting such data and explored reasons for dissimilar participant responses.                                                                                                                                Methods: Participants from open-label antimalarial and antiretroviral interaction trials in two distinct sites (South Africa, n?=?18 [all HIV positive]; Tanzania, n?=?80 [86% HIV positive]) were asked about ill health and treatment use by sequential use of (1) general enquiries without reference to particular conditions, body systems or treatments, (2) checklists of potential health issues and treatments, (3) in-depth interviews. Participants’ experiences of illness and treatment and their reporting behaviour were explored qualitatively, as were trial clinicians’ experiences with obtaining participant reports. Outcomes were the number and nature of data by questioning method, themes from qualitative analyses and a theoretical interpretation of participants’ experiences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Results: There was an overall cumulative increase in the number of reports from general enquiry through checklists to in-depth interview; in South Africa, an additional 12 medical histories, 21 AEs and 27 medications; in Tanzania an additional 260 medical histories, 1 AE and 11 medications. Checklists and interviews facilitated recognition of health issues and treatments, and consideration of what to report. Information was sometimes not reported because participants forgot, it was considered irrelevant or insignificant, or they feared reporting. Some medicine names were not known and answers to questions were considered inferior to blood tests for detecting ill health. South African inpatient volunteers exhibited a “trial citizenship”, working to achieve researchers’ goals, while Tanzanian outpatients sometimes deferred responsibility for identifying items to report to trial clinicians.       Conclusions: Questioning methods and trial contexts influence the detection of adverse events, medical histories and concomitant medications. There should be further methodological work to investigate these influences and find appropriate questioning methods."

This paper evaluates the protective effect of pyrethroid IRS and ITNs in relation to risk factors for malaria based on a study conducted in North-West Tanzania, where IRS has been conducted since 2007 and universal coverage of ITNs has been carried out recently. In 2011 community-based cross-sectional surveys were conducted in the two main malaria transmission periods that occur after the short and long rainy seasons. These included 5,152 and 4,325 children aged 0.5-14 years, respectively. Data on IRS and ITN coverage, household demographics and socio-economic status were collected using an adapted version of the Malaria Indicator Survey. Children were screened for malaria by rapid diagnostic test. In the second survey, haemoglobin density was measured and filter paper blood spots were collected to determine age-specific sero-prevalence in each community surveyed. Plasmodium falciparum infection prevalence in children 0.5-14 years old was 9.3% (95%CI:5.9-14.5) and 22.8% (95%CI:17.3-29.4) in the two surveys. Risk factors for infection after the short rains included households not being sprayed (OR?=?0.39; 95%CI:0.20-0.75); low community net ownership (OR?=?0.45; 95%CI:0.21-0.95); and low community SES (least poor vs. poorest tertile: OR?=?0.13, 95%CI:0.05-0.34). Risk factors after the long rains included household poverty (per quintile increase: OR?=?0.89; 95%CI:0.82-0.97) and community poverty (least poor vs. poorest tertile: OR?=?0.26, 95%CI:0.15-0.44); household IRS or high community ITN ownership were not protective. Despite high IRS coverage and equitable LLIN distribution, poverty was an important risk factor for malaria suggesting it could be beneficial to target additional malaria control activities to poor households and communities. High malaria prevalence in some clusters and the limited protection given by pyrethroid IRS and LLINs suggest that it may be necessary to enhance established vector control activities and consider additional interventions."

Methods: CD4 counts were assessed from time of diagnosis till the end of TB treatment in a cohort of pulmonary TB patients with and without HIV co-infection and compared with cross-sectional data on age- and sex-matched non-TB controls from the same area.                                                                                                                                                                                                Results: Of 1,605 study participants, 1,250 were PTB patients and 355 were non-TB controls. At baseline, HIV was associated with 246 (95% CI: 203; 279) cells per ?L lower CD4 counts. All PTB patients had 100 cells per ?L lower CD4 counts than the healthy controls. The CD4 levels were largely unchanged during a five-month of TB treatment. HIV infected patients not receiving ART at any time and those already on ART at baseline had no increase in CD4 counts after 5 months of TB treatment, whereas those prescribed ART between baseline and 2 months, and between 2 and 5 months increased by 69 (22;117) and 110 (52; 168) CD4 cells per ?L after 5 months.                                                                                                                      Conclusions: The increase in circulating CD4 levels observed in PTB in patients is acquired after 2 months of treatment irrespective of HIV status. Initiation of ART is the strongest factor correlated with CD4 increase during TB treatment."

Those with immunosuppression, such as HIV, are at higher risk of colonization and disease, especially at older ages. Currently, vaccination schedules are only offered to children under 6 months of age, despite the large impact of pneumococcal disease in older unvaccinated children with HIV. We conducted a study to assess the prevalence of, and risk factors for, pneumococcal carriage in HIV-positive children aged <15 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           METHODS: We collected a single nasopharyngeal swab from 142 HIV-infected children aged 1-14 years over a 2-month period. To detect carriage of pneumococcus, these samples were cultured and serotyped; PCR was performed on negative samples. We also collected epidemiological data via survey and medical records.                                                                               RESULTS: The overall carriage rate was 81% and was at least 76% in those aged 5-14 years. The 7-, 10-, and 13-valent pneumococcal vaccines would cover 37%, 37%, and 49% of children with carriage, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, we identified increase in weight since last visit (p=0.028) and the existence of care-givers who had respiratory symptoms in the past week (p=0.022) as risk factors for carriage. Weight gain was also significantly associated with antiretroviral use (p=0.002).                                                                                      CONCLUSIONS: These data illuminate the little known area of pneumococcal carriage in older HIV-infected children as well as finding novel risk factors for pneumococcal carriage, namely the association with household members who have respiratory symptoms and with an increase in the child's weight prior to swabbing. Weight gain may be due to an increase in health enabling more mobility and increasing the risk of acquiring carriage. The carriage rate observed (81%) is one of the highest recorded. Further research should address whether vaccination can prevent the acquisition of carriage and so protect against disease."

Are changes in intended sugar avoidance associated with changes in cognitions as specified by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)? Are changes in oral health related knowledge associated with changes in attitudes and oral health behaviour? Method: A total of 1306 (follow-up prevalence 73.8%) primary school students in Kilwa, Tanzania completed interviews before and after a combined ART/OHE program. Post intervention at 6 months follow-up assessed changes in oral health related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours. Complete baseline and follow-up interviews were obtained from 221 and 1085 students who received ART/OHE and OHE only at schools, respectively. Results: Improvement was obtained with attitudes towards sugar avoidance, knowledge, and tooth brushing (effect sizes in the range 0.1-0.3). Within individual changes did not differ significantly between students receiving ART/ OHE and OHE only. Change scores of intended sugar avoidance associated in the expected direction with changes in sugar consumption. Attitudes and norms with respect to sugar avoidance deteriorated and improved among subjects who respectively decreased and increased intended sugar avoidance. Tooth brushing increased in students who improved oral knowledge. Conclusion: School based ART/OHE improved pupils’ tooth brushing, knowledge, and attitudes, but had no effect on sugar consumption. This study provided support for the validity of the TPB in predicting changes in intended sugar avoidance and reported sugar intake"

However antibody detection can be useful to indicate Schistosoma infection in those for whom eggs cannot be demonstrated. The aim of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of schistosomiasis and to evaluate the accuracy of indirect haemagglutination (IHA) and Western blot (WB) assays for the detection of anti-Schistosoma antibodies in 2 peripheral hospitals of the United Republic of Tanzania. Methods: Between February and March 2007 blood samples were collected from 297 non-severe febrile outpatients who attended Chake Chake Hospital, Pemba Island and Tosamaganga Hospital, Iringa region in Tanzania. The samples were processed for Schistosoma antibodies by IHA and WB assays in Italy. Results: Two hundred and sixty-two of 297 patients were schistosomiasis antibody-positive by IHA (88.2%). Of 142 patients positive by IHA, only 22 (12.4%) cases were confirmed by WB assay. The WB assay confirmed all 35 negative cases previously identified by IHA. The seroprevalence of Schistosoma at Chake Chake Hospital was lower than in Tosamaganga Hospital (9/97, 9.3% vs 13/80, 16.2%). Conclusions: Schistosomiasis is endemic in Tanzania, being more prevalent on the mainland than on Pemba Island. The implications of this study are of public health relevance and suggest the need for increased efforts in large-scale chemotherapy-based morbidity control programmes, integrated with those for other soil-transmitted helminthiases, in these 2 peripheral areas of the United Republic of Tanzania."

Moreover, data that are reviewed herein have been collected with respect to the rats' sensitivity and specificity in detecting tuberculosis. Findings strongly suggest that scent-detecting rats offer a quick and practical tool for detecting pulmonary tuberculosis and within the year APOPO's tuberculosis-detection project will be extended to Mozambique. As part of its local capacity building effort, APOPO hires and trains Tanzanians to play many important roles in its TB detection project and provides research and training opportunities for Tanzanian students."

Health staff working in the front line of the health service delivery system has a major responsibility for timely identification and referral of suspected cases of childhood tuberculosis. This study explored primary health care staff's perception, challenges and needs pertaining to the identification of children with tuberculosis in Muheza district in Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                  Methods: We conducted a qualitative study that included 13 semi-structured interviews and 3 focus group discussions with a total of 29 health staff purposively sampled from primary health care facilities. Analysis was performed in accordance with the principles of a phenomenological analysis.                                                                                                                        Results: Primary health care staff perceived childhood tuberculosis to be uncommon in the society and tuberculosis was rarely considered as a likely differential diagnosis. Long duration and severe signs of disease together with known exposure to tuberculosis were decisive for the staff to suspect tuberculosis in children and refer them to hospital. None of the staff felt equipped to identify cases of childhood tuberculosis and they experienced lack of knowledge, applicable tools and guidelines as the main challenges. They expressed the need for more training, supervision and referral feedback to improving case identification.                                                                                                                                                                         Conclusions: Inadequate awareness of the burden of childhood tuberculosis, limited knowledge of the wide spectrum of clinical presentation and lack of clinical decision support strategies is detrimental to the health staff's central responsibility of suspecting and referring children with tuberculosis especially in the early disease stages. Activities to improve case identification should focus on skills required by primary health care staff to fulfil their responsibility and reflect primary health care level capacities and challenges."

Erythrocytes infected by these malaria-causing parasites accumulate through adhesive interactions in placental intervillous spaces, thus evading detection in peripheral blood smears. Sequestered infected erythrocytes induce inflammation, offering the possibility of detecting inflammatory mediators in peripheral blood that could act as biomarkers of placental infection. In a longitudinal, prospective study in Tanzania, we quantified a range of different cytokines, chemokines and angiogenic factors in peripheral plasma samples, taken on multiple sequential occasions during pregnancy up to and including delivery, from P. falciparum-infected women and matched uninfected controls. The results show that during healthy, uninfected pregnancies the levels of most of the panel of molecules we measured were largely unchanged except at delivery. In women with P. falciparum, however, both comparative and longitudinal assessments consistently showed that the levels of IL-10 and IP-10 increased significantly whilst that of RANTES decreased significantly, regardless of gestational age at the time the infection was detected. ROC curve analysis indicated that a combination of increased IL-10 and IP-10 levels and decreased RANTES levels might be predictive of P. falciparum infections. In conclusion, our data suggest that host biomarkers in peripheral blood may represent useful diagnostic markers of P. falciparum infection during pregnancy, but placental histology results would need to be included to verify these findings."

Study Design: Infants and children ?2 <18 months admitted to hospital with an acute febrile illness had two rapid antibody tests in parallel, with single and parallel results subsequently compared against NAAT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Results: HIV prevalence among 1,602 enrolled infants was 3.4%. All 1,526 infants with 2 negative RT were HIV negative by NAAT. All 46 infants with 2 positive RT were HIV positive by NAAT. The overall specificity of two rapid tests for excluding HIV infection was 99.5%. Sensitivity and specificity were ? 99% and >98%, respectively, across all age brackets ?2 <18 months. Overall sensitivity and specificity for a single RT was 98.2% and 99%, respectively, for Determine, and 85.5% and 99.6%, respectively, for Capillus.                                           Conclusions:In a setting with a maternal HIV prevalence rate of <10%, a single negative RT had excellent specificity and two negative RT performed in parallel had a perfect negative predictive value for HIV infection among acutely ill patients < 18 months of age. In this and similar settings, RT could assist with excluding HIV infection with much lower complexity and cost than NAAT."

As part of investigations into possible causes for the change in vector population density, the present study analysed the Anopheles gambiae s.l. sibling species composition in north-eastern Tanzania. The study was in two parts. The first compared current species complex composition in freshly caught An. gambiae s.l. complex from three villages to the composition reported from previous studies carried out 2-4 decades ago in the same villages. The second took advantage of a sample of archived dried An. gambiae s.l. complex specimens collected regularly from a fourth study village since 2005. Both fresh and archived dried specimens were identified to sibling species of the An. gambiae s.l. complex by PCR. The same specimens were moreover examined for Plasmodium falciparum and Wuchereria bancrofti infection by PCR. As in earlier studies, An. gambiae s.s., Anopheles merus and Anopheles arabiensis were identified as sibling species found in the area. However, both study parts indicated a marked change in sibling species composition over time. From being by far the most abundant in the past An. gambiae s.s. was now the most rare, whereas An. arabiensis had changed from being the most rare to the most common. P. falciparum infection was rarely detected in the examined specimens (and only in An. arabiensis) whereas W. bancrofti infection was prevalent and detected in all three sibling species. The study indicates that a major shift in An. gambiae s.l. sibling species composition has taken place in the study area in recent years. Combined with the earlier reported decline in overall malaria vector density, the study suggests that this decline has been most marked for An. gambiae s.s., and least for An. arabiensis, leading to current predominance of the latter. Due to differences in biology and vectorial capacity of the An. gambiae s.l. complex the change in sibling species composition will have important implications for the epidemiology and control of malaria and lymphatic filariasis in the study area."

Therefore, we tested 345 reproductive age women in rural Tanzanian villages near Lake Victoria, where S. mansoni is hyperendemic, for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and schistosomiasis by circulating anodic antigen (CAA) serum assay. Over one-half (54%) had an active schistosome infection; 6% were HIV-seropositive. By univariate analysis, only schistosome infection predicted HIV infection (odds ratio [OR] = 3.9, 95% confidence interval = [1.3-12.0], P = 0.015) and remained significant using multivariate analysis to control for age, STIs, and distance from the lake (OR = 6.2 [1.7-22.9], P = 0.006). HIV prevalence was higher among women with more intense schistosome infections (P = 0.005), and the median schistosome intensity was higher in HIV-infected than -uninfected women (400 versus 15 pg CAA/mL, P = 0.01). This finding suggests that S. mansoni infection may be a modifiable HIV risk factor that places millions of people worldwide at increased risk of HIV acquisition."

Results: In developing countries, diabetes predominantly affects working-age persons, has high rates of complications and devastating economic impacts. These countries are ill-equipped to handle advanced stages of the disease. There are acceptable and relatively simple tools that can aid screening in these countries. Interventions shown to be cost-effective in preventing diabetes and its complications in developed countries can be used in screen-detected people of developing countries. However, effective implementation of these interventions remains a challenge, and the costs and benefits of diabetes screening in these settings are less well-known. Implementing screening policies in developing countries will require health systems strengthening, through creative funding and staff training.

Three hundred and sixty pupils who have never been treated previously were enrolled (180 males/180 females, age 6-17 years [median 10 years]) in three different schools of the island. Double stool samples were collected from each pupil and egg excretion was classified according to WHO recommendations. Ultrasound investigations were performed in accordance with the WHO Niamey-Belo-Horizonte protocol. Male (112/180, 62.2%) and female (104/180; 57.7%) pupils were infected (difference, not significant [n.s.]). In the positive 216 cases, egg excretion varied from 1 to 2,440 eggs per gramme stool (epg) [median 165 epg]. There were 69/216 (31.9%) who had a low grade, 105/216 (53.2%) had a moderate and 42/216 (14.8%) had a heavy infection. There was no significant difference between male and female sex nor with regard to age groups. There were 354/360 children who underwent sonography: 321 (90.7%) had splenomegaly, 316 (89.3%) showed a left lobe and 109 (30.9%) had a right lobe hepatomegaly. Overt signs of portal fibrosis (PF) were present in 19 children (5.4%) out of whom 11 presented with echogenic thickening of peripheral portal and 8 with thickening of central portal branches. Non-specific portal wall changes were seen in 6 children (1.7%). Association of PF to quantitative egg excretion was not seen (median in PF, 172 epg vs. median in non PF, 168 epg; difference, n.s.). Portal vein dilatation was seen in 101/354 (28.5%) cases. In Ukerewe, the prevalence of S. mansoni infection and infection intensity in children is high, yet overt hepatic morbidity is low as compared to other endemic foci. Non-specific ultrasonographic abnormalities including hepatosplenomegaly and portal vein dilatation were seen frequently but the fraction attributable to schistosomiasis is difficult to assess."

Methods: Data were collected in 2011 as part of a larger cross-sectional survey on condom use among 10–19?year-olds in Mpwapwa and Mbeya rural districts of Tanzania using a structured questionnaire. Associations between acceptability of condom promotion and distribution and each of the explanatory variables were tested using Chi Square. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine independent predictors of the acceptability of condom promotion and distribution using STATA (11) statistical software at 5% significance level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Results: Mean age of the 1,327 adolescent participants (50.5% being males) was 13.5?years (SD?=?1.4). Acceptance of condom promotion and distribution was found among 37% (35% in Mpwapwa and 39% in Mbeya rural) of the adolescents. Being sexually active and aged 15–19 was the strongest predictor of the acceptability of condom promotion and distribution (OR?=?7.78, 95% CI 4.65-12.99). Others were; not agreeing that a condom is effective in preventing transmissions of STIs including HIV (OR?=?0.34, 95% CI 0.20-0.56), being a resident of Mbeya rural district (OR?=?1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.19), feeling comfortable being seen by parents/guardians holding/buying condoms (OR?=?2.20, 95% CI 1.40-3.46) and living with a guardian (OR?=?1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.04).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Conclusion: Acceptability of condom promotion and distribution among adolescents in Mpwapwa and Mbeya rural is low. Effect of sexual activity on the acceptability of condom promotion and distribution is age-dependent and was the strongest. Feeling comfortable being seen by parents/guardians buying or holding condoms, perceived ability of condoms to offer protection against HIV/AIDS infections, district of residence and living arrangements also offered significant predictive effect. Knowledge of these factors is vital in designing successful and sustainable condom promotion and distribution programs in Tanzania."

While little is known about predictors of diabetes among healthy individuals in Africa, predictors among TB patients are almost non-existent.

METHODS: TB patients were tested for diabetes using an oral glucose tolerance test, demographic information was collected and anthropometric measurements taken. The association between diabetes and possible predictors were examined using logistic regression analyses.                                                                                                                                                                  RESULTS: Of 1205 TB patients, 16.4% (n = 197) had diabetes, 9.0% (n = 108) were aged ?55 years, 3.3% (n = 40) were overweight (body mass index [BMI] ? 25 kg/m(2)) and 12.7% (n = 152) severely underweight (BMI < 16 kg/m(2)). Diabetes was most prevalent in the 45-55 year age group, and increasing weight, BMI and waist circumference were associated with diabetes. Severe underweight (BMI < 16 kg/m(2)) among male TB patients (sex-BMI interaction, P = 0.02) was associated with diabetes (OR 2.52, P = 0.004).                                                             CONCLUSION: Diabetes is a common comorbidity among TB patients. Although diabetes was associated with obesity and was more prevalent among the middle-aged, the majority of TB patients with diabetes comorbidity were young and lean. With diabetes as a major risk factor for TB, and with the lack of strong predictors for diabetes, universal diabetes screening should be implemented in the TB programme"

Serum C-reactive protein (B 18.8 mg/l, CI 95% 8.2; 29.4, P = 0.001) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (B 0.2 g/l, CI 95% 0.03; 0.3, P = 0.02) were similarly higher in patients with diabetes. Diabetes did not affect culture intensity or HIV status, but self-reported fever was three times higher among participants with diabetes than in those without diabetes (OR 2.9, CI 95% 1.5; 5.7, P = 0.002).     CONCLUSION: Diabetes is associated with small changes in the manifestations of TB, but may have little clinical significance."

METHODS: Data on all-cause, AIDS and non-AIDS mortality among 15-59 year olds were analysed from demographic surveillance sites (DSS) in Karonga (Malawi), Kisesa (Tanzania), Masaka (Uganda) and the Africa Centre (South Africa), using Poisson regression. Trends over time from up to 5 years prior to ART roll-out, to 4-6 years afterwards, are presented, overall and by age and sex. For Masaka and Kisesa, trends are analysed separately for HIV-negative and HIV-positive individuals. For Karonga and the Africa Centre, trends in AIDS and non-AIDS mortality are analysed using verbal autopsy data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          RESULTS: For all-cause mortality, overall rate ratios (RRs) comparing the period 2-6 years following ART roll-out with the pre-ART period were 0.58 (5.9 vs. 10.2 deaths per 1000 person-years) in Karonga, 0.79 (7.2 vs. 9.1 deaths per 1000 person-years) in Kisesa, 0.61 (6.7 compared with 11.0 deaths per 1000 person-years) in Masaka and 0.79 (14.8 compared with 18.6 deaths per 1000 person-years) in the Africa Centre DSS. The mortality decline was seen only in HIV-positive individuals/AIDS mortality, with no decline in HIV-negative individuals/non-AIDS mortality. Less difference was seen in Kisesa where ART uptake was lower.                                                                                                                                                                           CONCLUSIONS: Falls in all-cause mortality are consistent with ART uptake. The largest falls occurred where ART provision has been decentralised or available locally, suggesting that this is important."

The WHO and UNAIDS recommend male circumcision as an additional intervention to prevent HIV infection. Tanzania is embarking on activities to scale up safe male circumcision for HIV prevention and other related health benefits. In line with this, it is crucial to assess views of the population using specific groups. This paper describes perceptions on male circumcision and strategies of enhancing uptake of male circumcision in urban Tanzania using members of the police force. This cross sectional survey was conducted among members of the police force in Dar es Salaam Tanzania from January 2010 to July 2010. The police officer serves as a source of the clinical trial participants in on-going phase I/II HIV vaccine trials. Three hundred and thirteen (313) police officers responded to a self-administered questionnaire that comprised of socio-demographic characteristics, reasons for not circumcising, perceptions regarding circumcision, methods of enhancing male circumcision, communication means and barriers to promote circumcision. This was followed by a physical examination to determine male circumcision status. The prevalence of circumcision was 96%. Most (69%) reported to have been circumcised in the hospital. The reported barriers to male circumcision among adults and children were: anticipation of pain, cost, fear to lose body parts, and lack of advice for adult's circumcision. Sensitization of parents who take children to the reproductive and child health services was recommended by most respondents as the appropriate strategy to promote male circumcision. The least recommended strategy was for the women to sensitize men. Use of radio programs and including male circumcision issues in school curricula as means of enhancing community sensitization regarding male circumcision were also highly recommended. Other recommendations include use of public media, seminars at work and issuance of circumcision regulations by health authorities. In conclusion, the present study reveals male circumcision was common in a selected urban population. There are various barriers and channels of communication regarding male circumcision. In view of scaling male circumcision in Tanzania, use of radio messages, inclusion of male circumcision in the school curricula and sensitization at the reproductive and child health clinics are likely to promote early medical male circumcision."

RVFV mostly causes outbreaks among domestic ruminants with a major economic impact. Human infections are associated with these events, with a fatality rate of 0.5-2%. Since the virus is able to use many mosquito species of temperate climates as vectors, it has a high potential to spread to outside Africa.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a stratified, cross-sectional sero-prevalence survey in 1228 participants from Mbeya region, southwestern Tanzania. Samples were selected from 17,872 persons who took part in a cohort study in 2007 and 2008. RVFV IgG status was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Possible risk factors were analyzed using uni- and multi-variable Poisson regression models. We found a unique local maximum of RVFV IgG prevalence of 29.3% in a study site close to Lake Malawi (N?=?150). The overall seroprevalence was 5.2%. Seropositivity was significantly associated with higher age, lower socio-economic status, ownership of cattle and decreased with distance to Lake Malawi. A high vegetation density, higher minimum and lower maximum temperatures were found to be associated with RVFV IgG positivity. Altitude of residence, especially on a small scale in the high-prevalence area was strongly correlated (PR 0.87 per meter, 95% CI?=?0.80-0.94). Abundant surface water collections are present in the lower areas of the high-prevalence site. RVF has not been diagnosed clinically, nor an outbreak detected in the high-prevalence area.                                                                                                                                                          CONCLUSIONS:RVFV is probably circulating endemically in the region. The presence of cattle, dense vegetation and temperate conditions favour mosquito propagation and virus replication in the vector and seem to play major roles in virus transmission and circulation. The environmental risk-factors that we identified could serve to more exactly determine areas at risk for RVFV endemicity."

This study aims to assess the prevalence of hypertension and determinants of blood pressure in four SSA populations in rural Nigeria and Kenya, and urban Namibia and Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed four cross-sectional household surveys in Kwara State, Nigeria; Nandi district, Kenya; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Greater Windhoek, Namibia, between 2009-2011. Representative population-based samples were drawn in Nigeria and Namibia. The Kenya and Tanzania study populations consisted of specific target groups. Within a final sample size of 5,500 households, 9,857 non-pregnant adults were eligible for analysis on hypertension. Of those, 7,568 respondents ? 18 years were included. The primary outcome measure was the prevalence of hypertension in each of the populations under study. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was 19.3% (95%CI:17.3-21.3) in rural Nigeria, 21.4% (19.8-23.0) in rural Kenya, 23.7% (21.3-26.2) in urban Tanzania, and 38.0% (35.9-40.1) in urban Namibia. In individuals with hypertension, the proportion of grade 2 (? 160/100 mmHg) or grade 3 hypertension (? 180/110 mmHg) ranged from 29.2% (Namibia) to 43.3% (Nigeria). Control of hypertension ranged from 2.6% in Kenya to 17.8% in Namibia. Obesity prevalence (BMI ? 30) ranged from 6.1% (Nigeria) to 17.4% (Tanzania) and together with age and gender, BMI independently predicted blood pressure level in all study populations. Diabetes prevalence ranged from 2.1% (Namibia) to 3.7% (Tanzania).                                                                                                                                                      CONCLUSION: Hypertension was the most frequently observed risk factor for CVD in both urban and rural communities in SSA and will contribute to the growing burden of CVD in SSA. Low levels of control of hypertension are alarming. Strengthening of health care systems in SSA to contain the emerging epidemic of CVD is urgently needed."

P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) is released by mature sequestered parasites and can be used to estimate the total parasite burden. We investigated the prognostic significance of plasma PfHRP2 and used it to estimate the malaria-attributable fraction in African children diagnosed with severe malaria.                                                   METHODS AND FINDINGS: Admission plasma PfHRP2 was measured prospectively in African children (from Mozambique, The Gambia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) aged 1 month to 15 years with severe febrile illness and a positive P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH)-based rapid test in a clinical trial comparing parenteral artesunate versus quinine (the AQUAMAT trial, ISRCTN 50258054). In 3,826 severely ill children, Plasmadium falciparum PfHRP2 was higher in patients with coma (p = 0.0209), acidosis (p<0.0001), and severe anaemia (p<0.0001). Admission geometric mean (95%CI) plasma PfHRP2 was 1,611 (1,350-1,922) ng/mL in fatal cases (n = 381) versus 1,046 (991-1,104) ng/mL in survivors (n = 3,445, p<0.0001), without differences in parasitaemia as assessed by microscopy. There was a U-shaped association between log(10) plasma PfHRP2 and risk of death. Mortality increased 20% per log(10) increase in PfHRP2 above 174 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.21, 95%CI 1.05-1.39, p = 0.009). A mechanistic model assuming a PfHRP2-independent risk of death in non-malaria illness closely fitted the observed data and showed malaria-attributable mortality less than 50% with plasma PfHRP2?174 ng/mL. The odds ratio (OR) for death in artesunate versus quinine-treated patients was 0.61 (95%CI 0.44-0.83, p = 0.0018) in the highest PfHRP2 tertile, whereas there was no difference in the lowest tertile (OR 1.05; 95%CI 0.69-1.61; p = 0.82). A limitation of the study is that some conclusions are drawn from a mechanistic model, which is inherently dependent on certain assumptions. However, a sensitivity analysis of the model indicated that the results were robust to a plausible range of parameter estimates. Further studies are needed to validate our findings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CONCLUSIONS:Plasma PfHRP2 has prognostic significance in African children with severe falciparum malaria and provides a tool to stratify the risk of ""true"" severe malaria-attributable disease as opposed to other severe illnesses in parasitaemic African children."

We used ex vivo flow cytometry to identify peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) profiles that are associated with PAM and anaemia, determining the phenotypic composition and activation status of PBMC in selected sub-groups with and without PAM both at inclusion and at delivery in a total of 302 women. Both at inclusion and at delivery PAM was associated with significantly increased frequencies both of B cells overall and of activated B cells. Infection-related profiles were otherwise quite distinct at the two different time-points. At inclusion, PAM was associated with anaemia, with an increased frequency of immature monocytes and with a decreased frequency of regulatory T cells (Treg). At delivery, infected women presented with significantly fewer plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC), more myeloid DC expressing low levels of HLA-DR, and more effector T cells (Teff) compared to uninfected women. Independent associations with an increased risk of anaemia were found for altered antigen-presenting cell frequencies at inclusion, but for an increased frequency of Teff at delivery. Our findings emphasize the prominent role played by B cells during PAM whenever it arises during pregnancy, whilst also revealing signature changes in other circulating cell types that, we conclude, primarily reflect the relative duration of the infections. Thus, the acute, recently-acquired infections present at delivery were marked by changes in DC and Teff frequencies, contrasting with infections at inclusion, considered chronic in nature, that were characterized by an abundance of immature monocytes and a paucity of Treg in PBMC."

The present study evaluated the comparative efficacy for collection of Cx quinquefasciatus of four commercially available gravid traps: the CDC, Frommer Updraft, Reiter-Cummings and Harris County traps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            METHOD: Trap evaluations were conducted in two locations in Tanzania, Ifakara and Tanga. Mosquitoes collected were identified to species, sex, and gonotrophic status.                         RESULTS: In both locations, the CDC gravid trap collected the highest number of mosquitoes, the highest number of Cx quinquefasciatus, and the highest proportion of gravid mosquitoes. Although it damaged the highest proportion of mosquitoes as they passed through the trap fan, the CDC gravid trap also contained the highest number of living mosquitoes, when the traps were collected in the morning. The CDC gravid traps collected significantly more phlebotomine sandflies than the other traps and in Tanga, where they were more frequent, the highest number of biting midges.

METHODS: During two rounds of linked serological surveys (2003-2004 and 2006-2007) with anonymous HIV testing among adults, VCT was offered to all participants. The crude and adjusted odds ratios for completing VCT in each survey were calculated to compare uptake by demographic, behavioural and clinical characteristics, stratified by sex. Repeat testing patterns were also investigated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         RESULTS: The proportion of participants completing VCT increased from 10% in 2003-2004 to 17% in 2006-2007, and among HIV-infected persons from 14% to 25%. A higher proportion of men than women completed VCT in both rounds, but the difference declined over time. Socio-demographic and behavioural factors associated with VCT completion were similar across rounds, including higher adjusted odds of VCT with increasing numbers of sexual partners in the past 12 months. The proportion having ever-completed VCT reached 26% among 2006-2007 attendees, with repeat testing rates highest among those aged 35-44 years. Among 3923 participants attending both rounds, VCT completion in 2006-2007 was 17% among 3702 who were HIV negative in both rounds, 19% among 124 who were HIV infected in both rounds and 22% among 96 who seroconverted between rounds.                                                CONCLUSION:VCT services are attracting HIV-infected and high-risk individuals. However, 2 years after the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, the overall uptake remains low. Intensive mobilisation efforts are needed to achieve regular and universal VCT use."

METHODS:WHO standard methods were used to detect knock-down and mortality in the wild female Anopheles mosquitoes collected in sentinel districts. The WHO diagnostic doses of 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.05% lambdacyhalothrin, 0.75% permethrin and 4% DDT were used.                                                                                                                                                                          RESULTS: The major malaria vectors in Tanzania, Anopheles gambiae s.l., were susceptible (mortality rate of 98-100%) to permethrin, deltamethrin, lambdacyhalothrin and DDT in most of the surveyed sites. However, some sites recorded marginal susceptibility (mortality rate of 80-97%); Ilala showed resistance to DDT (mortality rate of 65% [95% CI, 54-74]), and Moshi showed resistance to lambdacyhalothrin (mortality rate of 73% [95% CI, 69-76]) and permethrin (mortality rate of 77% [95% CI, 73-80]).                                                                         CONCLUSIONS: The sustained susceptibility of malaria vectors to pyrethroid in Tanzania is encouraging for successful malaria control with Insecticide-treated nets and IRS. However, the emergency of focal points with insecticide resistance is alarming. Continued monitoring is essential to ensure early containment of resistance, particularly in areas that recorded resistance or marginal susceptibility and those with heavy agricultural and public health use of insecticides."

But the serological memory to this antigen tends to be short-lived, and little is known of the mechanisms that regulate the formation of B cell memory to MSP-1(19) antigen. We studied the formation of B cell memory response after immunization with the recombinant 19-kDa Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1 (PfMSP-1(19)). Immunization with PfMSP-1(19) resulted in delayed increase in germinal center (GC) B cell numbers. This poor GC reaction correlated with short-lived PfMSP-1(19)-specific antibodies in serum and the short life of PfMSP-1(19)-specific plasma cells and memory B cells (MBCs) in spleen and bone marrow. PfMSP-1(19)-specific MBCs were capable of producing antigen (Ag)-specific Ab-secreting cell (ASC) responses that were short-lived following challenge immunization of the immune mice with antigen or transgenic Plasmodium berghei parasite expressing PfMSP-1(19) in place of native P. berghei MSP-1(19) at 8 weeks after the last immunization or following adoptive transfer into naive hosts. However, no protection was achieved in PfMSP-1(19) immune mice or recipient mice with PfMSP-1(19)-specific MBCs following challenge with transgenic P. berghei. Our findings suggest that PfMSP-1(19)-specific IgG production by short-lived plasma cells combined with the poor ability of the PfMSP-1(19)-induced MBCs to maintain the anamnestic IgG responses failed to contribute to protection against infection."

This prospective hospital based cross sectional study was conducted from April 2007 to April 2008. The main objective was to assess clinical manifestations and outcomes of severe malaria in children admitted to district hospital in Rungwe and Kyela in south-western Tanzania. A total of 1371 children were selected as screening group of which 409 (29.8%) were tested positive for malaria. Mean age of the children was 2.7 (95%CI= 2.5, 2.8) years and the majority (86%) were under five years of age. The proportion of children severe malaria in Rungwe was significantly higher than that of Kyela by 21.3% (P=0.002). The common symptoms of severe malaria during admission were convulsions (50.9%) compensated shock (30.6%), prostration (29.1%) and symptomatic severe anaemia (14.9%). The case fatality rate (CFR) was 4.6% and the cure rate (CR) was 95.4%. Children with suspected severe acidosis and symptomatic severe anemia were 4.8 (95%CI=1.6, 14.6) and 5.5 (95%CI 1.1, 28.2), respectively, more likely to die compared to those without these symptoms. The proportion of deaths among children presenting ?5 symptoms was 32.1% higher than among those presenting one symptom (OR =0.50, 95%CI 0.125-2.000; P=0.000). Convulsions and compensated shock were the leading symptoms at admission. Suspected severe acidosis and symptomatic severe anemia were the predictors of mortality for children. In order to reduce mortality among admitted children with severe malaria there is a need for health providers to deploy strategic management of fatal prognostic factors. In conclusion, convulsion and compensated shock were the leading symptoms among children at admission and that suspected severe acidosis and symptomatic severe anemia were the predictors of mortality. It is therefore important to emphasis early diagnosis and prompt treatment of severe cases of malaria to minimize mortality among children."

While several studies have examined the impact of HIV on childbearing in Africa, few have focused on the antenatal/postpartum period. Addressing this research gap will help tailor contraceptive counseling to HIV-positive women's needs. Our study measures how antenatal HIV diagnosis affects postpartum childbearing desires, adjusting for effects of HIV before diagnosis. A baseline survey on reproductive behavior was administered to 5,284 antenatal clients before they underwent routine HIV testing. Fifteen months later, a follow-up survey collected information on postpartum reproductive behavior from 2,162 women, and in-depth interviews with 25 women investigated attitudes toward HIV and childbearing. HIV diagnosis was associated with a long-term downward adjustment in childbearing desires, but not with changes in short-term postpartum desires. The qualitative interviews identified health concerns and nurses' dissuasion as major factors discouraging childbearing post-diagnosis. At the same time, pronatalist social norms appeared to pressure women to continue childbearing. Given the potential for fertility desires to change following antenatal HIV diagnosis, contraceptive counseling should be provided on a continuum from antenatal through postpartum care, taking into account the conflicting pressures faced by HIV-positive women in relation to childbearing."

",Measurement of lumefantrine and its metabolite in plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection, lumefantrine and its metabolite,Journal of Pharmaceuticals and Biomedical Analysis,2011,54,1,168,172,12,,,,,,,,,"Artemether-lumefantrine (ARM-LUM) has in recent years become the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in many Sub-Saharan African countries. Vigorous monitoring of the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment is needed. This requires high-quality studies following standard protocols; ideally, such studies should incorporate measurement of drug levels in the study patients to exclude the possibility that insufficient drug levels explain an observed treatment failure. Several methods for measuring lumefantrine (LUM) in plasma by HPLC are available; however, several of these methods have some limitations in terms of high costs and limited feasibility arising from large required sample volumes and demanding sample preparation. Therefore, we set out to develop a simpler reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method based on UV detection for simultaneous measurement of LUM and its major metabolite the desbutyl LUM (DL) in plasma. Halofantrine was used as an internal standard. Liquid–liquid extraction of samples was carried out using hexane–ethyl acetate (70:30, v/v). Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Synergi Polar-RP column (250 mm × 300 mm, particle size 4 ?m). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile–0.1 M ammonium acetate buffer adjusted to pH 4.9 (85:15%, v/v). Absorbance of the compounds was monitored at 335 nm using a reference wavelength of 360 nm. Absolute extraction recovery for LUM and DL were 88% and 90%, respectively. Inter- and intraday coefficients of variation for LUM and DL were ?10%. The lower limits of quantification for LUM and DL were 12.5 and 6.5 ng/ml, respectively. After validation, the methodology was transferred to a local laboratory in Tanga Tanzania and samples from a small subset of malaria patients were analysed for LUM. The method appears to be applicable in settings with limited facilities."

The objective of the current evaluation was to assess the operational characteristics of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) Hep-cell II against an ELISA Exsym HBsAg in the detection of hepatitis B surface antigens. To evaluate the Hepcell II test, blood samples were collected from blood donors and processed for detection of HBsAg using Hep-cell II based on the test principle and procedure outlined by the manufacturer. ELISA Axsym HBsAg test was used as golden standard. Of the 400 samples tested, 287 (71.8%) were positive by Hep-cell test and 295 (73.8%) were positive by the ELISA Axsym. Hep-cell test had a sensitivity of 98.6% and specificity of 95.96%. Similar values of sensitivity and specificity of the Hep-cell test were obtained even when Bayesian Analysis Model was applied. The positive and negative predictive values of Hep-cell test were 98.61% and 95.96%, respectively. The positive and negative diagnostic likelihood ratios of Hep-cell test were 24.4% and 0.0145, respectively. In conclusion, the Hep-cell test is useful for detecting hepatitis B virus and the high likelihood ratio observed suggests that it may be useful in blood screening. However, it may be necessary to evaluate for cost-effectiveness and robustness in field conditions before the test is recommended for use."

Recent studies in Africa have indicated MC to be highly protective against HIV transmission. However, incorporating MC in HIV/AIDS prevention programme will increase its demand in Tanzania where traditional male circumcision is common and the health care system is weak. The objective of this study was to determine the challenges and opportunities of involving traditional practitioners in scaling up safe MC in the context of HIV prevention in Tanzania. The study was conducted in Monduli, Bahi and Mkuranga districts of Tanzania. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed. Household survey involved community members from the selected villages. In-depth interviews involved traditional practitioners and key informants at national, district and facility levels. A total of 601 householders were interviewed. Most (71.4%) household respondents preferred traditional MC as it was part of their culture and tradition. A similar response was obtained from other respondents. It was mostly preferred because it was used as an initiation school, turning of boys to warriors and sense of social cohesion. Only 228 (37.9%) of the respondents were aware of the adverse events associated with MC. The most frequently mentioned adverse effects were severe bleeding (65.0%), delayed wound healing (17.5%) and wound sepsis (8.4%). The risk of acquiring HIV through male circumcision practice was poorly known among community members except medical respondents. Single unsterilized local surgical equipment was used to circumcise several initiates. It was observed that interference with traditional values associated with circumcision to be the main hindrance of linkage between traditional and conventional practitioners. On the other hand it was reported that there was no policy or guidelines on Traditional MC (TMC). Most of respondents supported the efforts to establish and promote formal linkages between traditional and conventional practitioners. In conclusion, under the current HIV pandemic and TMC being prevalent in Tanzania, it is high time for the government to establish a linkage between traditional and conventional practitioners for safe practices in order to minimize HIV transmission."

Shifts in malaria vector species ratio have coincided with the scale-up suggesting that some species are being controlled by ITNs/LLINs better than others.                                                     Methods: Between 2005–2006 six experimental hut trials of ITNs and LLINs were conducted in parallel at two field stations in northeastern Tanzania; the first station was in Lower Moshi Rice Irrigation Zone, an area where An. arabiensis predominates, and the second was in coastal Muheza, where An. gambiae and An. funestus predominate. Five pyrethroids and one carbamate insecticide were evaluated on nets in terms of insecticide-induced mortality, blood-feeding inhibition and exiting rates.                                                                                           Results: In the experimental hut trials mortality of An. arabiensis was consistently lower than that of An. gambiae and An. funestus. The mortality rates in trials with pyrethroid-treated nets ranged from 25–52% for An. arabiensis, 63–88% for An. gambiae s.s. and 53–78% for An. funestus. All pyrethroid-treated nets provided considerable protection for the occupants, despite being deliberately holed, with blood-feeding inhibition (percentage reduction in biting rates) being consistent between species. Veranda exiting rates did not differ between species. Percentage mortality of mosquitoes tested in cone bioassays on netting was similar for An. gambiae and An. arabiensis.                                                                                     Conclusions: LLINs and ITNs treated with pyrethroids were more effective at killing An. gambiae and An. funestus than An. arabiensis. This could be a major contributing factor to the species shifts observed in East Africa following scale up of LLINs. With continued expansion of LLIN coverage in Africa An. arabiensis is likely to remain responsible for residual malaria transmission, and species shifts might be reported over larger areas. Supplementary control measures to LLINs may be necessary to control this vector species."

However, few researchers have shared their community sensitisation strategies and experiences. We report on our perspective as researchers on the sensitisation activities undertaken for a phase II malaria vaccine trial in Kilifi District (Kenya) and Korogwe District (Tanzania), with the aim of informing and guiding the operational planning of future trials. We report wide variability in recruitment rates within both sites; a variability that occurred against a backdrop of similarity in overall approaches to sensitisation across the two sites but significant differences in community exposure to biomedical research. We present a range of potential factors contributing to these differences in recruitment rates, which we believe are worth considering in future community sensitisation plans. We conclude by arguing for carefully designed social science research around the implementation and impact of community sensitisation activities."

The virulence of P. falciparum infections is associated with the type of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes to anchor these to the vascular lining. Although var2csa, the var gene encoding the PfEMP1 associated with placental malaria, was discovered in 2003, the identification of the var/PfEMP1 variants associated with severe malaria in children has remained elusive. To identify var/PfEMP1 variants associated with severe disease outcome, we compared var transcript levels in parasites from 88 children with severe malaria and 40 children admitted to the hospital with uncomplicated malaria. Transcript analysis was performed by RT-quantitative PCR using a set of 42 primer pairs amplifying var subtype-specific loci covering most var/PfEMP1 subtypes. In addition, we characterized the near-full-length sequence of the most prominently expressed var genes in three patients diagnosed with severe anemia and/or cerebral malaria. The combined analysis showed that severe malaria syndromes, including severe anemia and cerebral malaria, are associated with high transcript levels of PfEMP1 domain cassette 8-encoding var genes. Transcript levels of group A var genes, including genes encoding domain cassette 13, were also significantly higher in patients with severe syndromes compared with those with uncomplicated malaria. This study specifies the var/PfEMP1 types expressed in severe malaria in children, and thereby provides unique targets for future efforts to prevent and treat severe malaria infections."

Additional use of insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs) might enhance elimination of LF infection. Between August 1998 and July 1999, all individuals aged 8 months from Magoda and Mpapayu villages in north-eastern Tanzania, were administered with monthly low dose diethylcarbamazine (DEC) at a dosage of 50mg in children aged < 15 years and 100mg in adults aged ? 15 years. ITNs were also distributed to Magoda in December 1998 and to Mpapayu in March 2001. The main objective of our study was to assess the impact of ITNs and low dose DEC on microfilaria (mf) prevalence and intensity and incidence of new mf infections. Four annual cross-sectional surveys were conducted between 1999 and 2004 in the two villages to screen for Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae in individuals aged ? 1 year. Overall, 80% of the population in Magoda and 66% in Mpapayu were covered during these surveys. Results revealed a significant decrease in both mf prevalence and intensity in both villages. Furthermore, there was a steady decrease in mf incidence in Magoda; with 36.7 cases per 1000 person years in 2000 and 7.4 in 2004. In Mpapayu, the incidence initially increased from 20.8 cases in 2000 to 24.3 in 2001 and then decreased to 7.2 cases in 2004. Individuals using ITNs in Magoda had significantly lower risk of mf (OR=0.681; 95%CI: 0.496-0.934); and the risk of new infections was reduced by 58.8% (95%CI: 30.3-75.4). These results suggest that when MDA is complemented with ITNs there is high likelihood to half filariasis transmission within a shorter period than using chemotherapy alone."

Ten pouched rats were trained to detect tuberculosis in sputum using operant conditioning techniques. The rats evaluated 910 samples previously evaluated by smear microscopy. All samples were also evaluated through culturing and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was performed on culture growths to classify the bacteria. Results. The patientwise sensitivity of microscopy was 58.0%, and the patient-wise specificity was 97.3%. Used as a group of 10 with a cutoff (defined as the number of rat indications to classify a sample as positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis) of 1, the rats increased new case detection by 46.8% relative to microscopy alone. The average samplewise sensitivity of the individual rats was 68.4% (range 61.1–73.8%), and the mean specificity was 87.3% (range 84.7–90.3%). Conclusion. These results suggest that pouched rats are a valuable adjunct to, and may be a viable substitute for, sputum smear microscopy as a tuberculosis diagnostic in resource-poor countries."

We compared the prevalence of 65 human SNP's, previously associated with altered risk of malaria, between Tanzanian children with and without severe malaria. Five hundred children, aged 1-10 years, with severe malaria were recruited from those admitted to hospital in Muheza, Tanzania and compared with matched controls. Genotyping was performed by Sequenom MassArray, and conventional PCR was used to detect deletions in the alpha-thalassaemia gene. SNPs in two X-linked genes were associated with altered risk of severe malaria in females but not in males: heterozygosity for one or other of two SNPs in the G6PD gene was associated with protection from all forms of severe disease whilst two SNPs in the gene encoding CD40L were associated with respiratory distress. A SNP in the adenyl cyclase 9 (ADCY9) gene was associated with protection from acidosis whilst a polymorphism in the IL-1? gene (IL1A) was associated with an increased risk of acidosis. SNPs in the genes encoding IL-13 and reticulon-3 (RTN3) were associated with increased risk of cerebral malaria. This study confirms previously known genetic associations with protection from severe malaria (HbS, G6PD). It identifies two X-linked genes associated with altered risk of severe malaria in females, identifies mutations in ADCY9, IL1A and CD40L as being associated with altered risk of severe respiratory distress and acidosis, both of which are characterised by high serum lactate levels, and also identifies novel genetic associations with severe malaria (TRIM5) and cerebral malaria(IL-13 and RTN3). Further studies are required to test the generality of these associations and to understand their functional consequences."

However, the extent to which they act independently is poorly understood. Our objective was to estimate the neonatal mortality risk associated with preterm birth when stratified by weight for gestational age in the high mortality setting of East Africa.                 METHODS AND FINDINGS: Members and collaborators of the Malaria and the MARCH Centers, at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, were contacted and protocols reviewed for East African studies that measured (1) birth weight, (2) gestational age at birth using antenatal ultrasound or neonatal assessment, and (3) neonatal mortality. Ten datasets were identified and four met the inclusion criteria. The four datasets (from Uganda, Kenya, and two from Tanzania) contained 5,727 births recorded between 1999-2010. 4,843 births had complete outcome data and were included in an individual participant level meta-analysis. 99% of 445 low birth weight (< 2,500 g) babies were either preterm (< 37 weeks gestation) or small for gestational age (below tenth percentile of weight for gestational age). 52% of 87 neonatal deaths occurred in preterm or small for gestational age babies. Babies born < 34 weeks gestation had the highest odds of death compared to term babies (odds ratio [OR] 58.7 [95% CI 28.4-121.4]), with little difference when stratified by weight for gestational age. Babies born 34-36 weeks gestation with appropriate weight for gestational age had just three times the likelihood of neonatal death compared to babies born term, (OR 3.2 [95% CI 1.0-10.7]), but the likelihood for babies born 34-36 weeks who were also small for gestational age was 20 times higher (OR 19.8 [95% CI 8.3-47.4]). Only 1% of babies were born moderately premature and small for gestational age, but this group suffered 8% of deaths. Individual level data on newborns are scarce in East Africa; potential biases arising due to the non-systematic selection of the individual studies, or due to the methods applied for estimating gestational age, are discussed.

METHODS: Serological and demographic surveillance rounds have been undertaken in a population of approximately 30,000 people since 1994. Free HIV care including ART has been available since 2005. Event history analysis was used to compare mortality rates among HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults in the 5-year period before and after the introduction of ART. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using exponential regression models. Interaction between time period and HIV status was assessed to investigate whether there was a non-linear relationship between these two variables.

RESULTS: In the previous 12 months, 80% of students had at least one steady sex partner (girlfriend), 71% had sex with a barmaid, 33% had sex with a casual partner and 83% had multiple sex partners. Condoms had been used at some time by 83% of students, and in the latest sexual encounter by 56%. However, only 37%, 22%, and 11% consistently used condoms during sex with girlfriends, casual partners and barmaids, respectively. Condom use was least popular during sex with barmaids, and 94% and 91% of students had experienced oral and anal sex with barmaids, respectively. STD infection was reported by 42% of students. Sex with barmaids was associated with alcohol and illicit drug intake, sex under their respective influences, and STD infection. Despite the high prevalence of these risky behaviors, 64% of students replied that they were at low or no risk of HIV infection.

However, for many years, there have been no sustainable control programmes and systematic data from observational and control studies are very limited in the public domain. To cover that gap, the present article reviews the epidemiology, malacology, morbidity, and the milestones the country has made in efforts to control schistosomiasis and discusses future control approaches. The available evidence indicates that, both urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis are still highly endemic in Tanzania and cause significant morbidity.Mass drug administration using praziquantel, currently used as a key intervention measure, has not been successful in decreasing prevalence of infection. There is therefore an urgent need to revise the current approach for the successful control of the disease. Clearly, these need to be integrated control measures."

Compared to expert reading of the same slide, the sensitivity of routine slide results of easily readable slides was 85.7% (95% confidence interval: 77.4–94.0), falling to 44.4% (95% confidence interval: 34.5–54.4) for slides that were ‘readable with difficulty’.                                                                 Conclusions: The commonest cause of inaccurate results was the quality of the slide itself, correction of which is likely to be achievable within existing resources. A minority of slide readers were unable to read slides even under ideal conditions, suggesting the need for a ‘slide reading licence’ scheme."

Malaria Journal 11:211",Reliability of rapid diagnostic tests in diagnosing pregnancy-associated malaria in north-eastern Tanzania, rapid diagnostic tests in diagnosing pregnancy-associated malaria,Malaria Journal ,2012,11,,211,,15,,,,,,,,,"Background: Accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment of pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) are key aspects in averting adverse pregnancy outcomes. Microscopy is the gold standard in malaria diagnosis, but it has limited detection and availability. When used appropriately, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) could be an ideal diagnostic complement to microscopy, due to their ease of use and adequate sensitivity in detecting even sub-microscopic infections. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is even more sensitive, but it is mainly used for research purposes. The accuracy and reliability of RDTs in diagnosing PAM was evaluated using microscopy and PCR.                                                                                                                               Methods: A cohort of pregnant women in north-eastern Tanzania was followed throughout pregnancy for detection of plasmodial infection using venous and placental blood samples evaluated by histidine rich protein 2 (HRP-2) and parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) based RDTs (Parascreen™) or HRP-2 only (Paracheck Pf® and ParaHIT®f), microscopy and nested Plasmodium species diagnostic PCR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Results: From a cohort of 924 pregnant women who completed the follow up, complete RDT and microscopy data was available for 5,555 blood samples and of these 442 samples were analysed by PCR. Of the 5,555 blood samples, 49 ((proportion and 95% confidence interval) 0.9% [0.7 -1.1]) samples were positive by microscopy and 91 (1.6% [1.3-2.0]) by RDT. Forty-six (50.5% [40.5 - 60.6]) and 45 (49.5% [39.4 – 59.5]) of the RDT positive samples were positive and negative by microscopy, respectively, whereas nineteen (42.2% [29.0 - 56.7]) of the microscopy negative, but RDT positive, samples were positive by PCR. Three (0.05% [0.02 - 0.2]) samples were positive by microscopy but negative by RDT. 351 of the 5,461 samples negative by both RDT and microscopy were tested by PCR and found negative. There was no statistically significant difference between the performances of the different RDTs. Conclusions: Microscopy underestimated the real burden of malaria during pregnancy and RDTs performed better than microscopy in diagnosing PAM. In areas where intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy may be abandoned due to low and decreasing malaria risk and instead replaced with active case management, screening with RDT is likely to identify most infections in pregnant women and out-performs microscopy as a diagnostic tool."

Tanzania introduced a TB Patient Centred Treatment (PCT) approach which gives new TB patients the choice between home-based treatment supervised by a treatment supporter of their own choice, and health facility–based treatment observed by a medical professional. The aim of this study was to assess the extent and determinants of adherence to anti-TB therapy in patients opting for home-based treatment under the novel PCT approach.                                                                                                                                                                                     Method: In this cross-sectional study, the primary outcome was the percentage of patients adherent to TB therapy as detected by the presence of isoniazid in urine (IsoScreen assay). The primary analysis followed a non-inferiority approach in which adherence could not be lower than 75%. Logistic regression was used to examine the influence of potentially predictive factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Results: A total of 651 new TB patients were included. Of these, 645 (99.1%) provided urine for testing and 617 patients (95.7%; 90%CI 94.3–96.9) showed a positive result. This result was statistically non-inferior to the postulated adherence level of 75% (p<0.001).                                                                                                                                                                                            Conclusions: Adherence to TB therapy under home-based Directly Observed Treatment can be ensured in programmatic settings. A reliable supply of medication and the careful selection of treatment supporters, who preferably live very close to the patient, are crucial success factors. Finally, we recommend a cohort study to assess the rate of adherence throughout the full course of TB treatment."

", Supply-related drivers of staff motivation for providing intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy in Tanzania: evidence from two rural districts, malaria,Malaria Journal ,2012,11,,48,,6,,,,,,,,,"Since its introduction in the national antenatal care (ANC) system in Tanzania in 2001, little evidence is documented regarding the motivation and performance of health workers (HWs) in the provision of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) services in the national ANC clinics and the implications such motivation and performance might have had on HWs and services' compliance with the recommended IPTp delivery guidelines. This paper describes the supply-related drivers of motivation and performance of HWs in administering IPTp doses among other ANC services delivered in public and private health facilities (HFs) in Tanzania, using a case study of Mkuranga and Mufindi districts. Interviews were conducted with 78 HWs participating in the delivery of ANC services in private and public HFs and were supplemented by personal communications with the members of the district council health management team. The research instrument used in the data collection process contained a mixture of closed and open-ended questions. Some of the open-ended questions had to be coded in the form that allowed their analysis quantitatively. In both districts, respondents acknowledged IPTp as an essential intervention, but expressed dissatisfaction with their working environments constraining their performance, including health facility (HF) unit understaffing; unsystematic and unfriendly supervision by CHMT members; limited opportunities for HW career development; and poor (HF) infrastructure and staff houses. Data also suggest that poor working conditions negatively affect health workers' motivation to perform for ANC (including IPTp) services. Similarities and differences were noted in terms of motivational factors for ANC service delivery between the HWs employed in private HFs and those in public HFs: those in private facilities were more comfortable with staff residential houses, HF buildings, equipment, availability of water, electricity and cups for clients to use while taking doses under direct observed therapy than their public facility counterparts. Employees in public HFs more acknowledged availability of clinical officers, nurses and midwives than their private facility counterparts. More results are presented and discussed. The study shows conditions related to staffing levels, health infrastructure and essential supplies being among the key determinants or drivers of frontline HWs' motivation to deliver ANC services in both private and public HFs. Efforts of the government to meet the maternal health related Millennium Development Goals and targets for specific interventions need to address challenges related to HWs' motivation to perform their duties at their work-places"

Findings: CP is a concept widely promoted, but few projects/programmes have demonstrated its practicability in different countries. In many countries, communities are partially involved in one or several stages of project cycles - priority setting, resource allocation, service management, project implementation and evaluation. There is tendency of informing communities to implement the decisions that have already been passed by elites or politicians. In most of the project/programmes, professionals dominate the decision making processes by downgrading the non-professionals or non-technical people’s knowledge and skills. CP concept is greatly misinterpreted and sometimes confused with community involvement. In some cases, the community participates in passive manner. There is no common approach to translate CP into practice and this perpetuates debates on how and to what extent to which the community members should participate.

Due to few socioeconomic studies done so far to evaluate the impact this pandemic, a study was designed and undertaken in 2001 to analyse how this disease had impacted on health service provision in Tanzania from a cost perspective. Methods: The study involved a review of health service management information documents at selected health facilities in nine regions within mainland Tanzania, interviews with health service workers (HWs) at selected health facilities and health managers at district and regional levels as well as focus group discussions with people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWA). Findings: We noted that on average, HIV/AIDS caused 72% of all the deaths recorded at the study hospitals. The health management information system (HMIS) missed some data in relation to HIV/AIDS services, including the costs of such services which limited the investigators’ ability to determine the actual costs impact. Using their experience, health managers and HWs reported substantial amounts of funds, labour time, supplies and other resources to have been spent on HIV/AIDS preventive and curative services. The frontline HWs reported to face a problem of identifying the PLWA among those who presented multiple illness conditions at HF levels which means sometimes the services given to such people could not be separated for easy costing from services delivered to other categories of the patients. Such respondents and their superiors (i.e. Health managers) testified that PLWA were being screened and receiving treatment. HWs were concerned with spending much time on counselling PLWA, attending home-based care, sick-leaves and funeral ceremonies either after their relatives or co-staff have died of AIDS, lowering time for delivering services to other patients. HWs together with their superiors at district and regional levels reported increasing shortages of essential supplies, office-working space and other facilities at HF levels, although actual costs of such items were not documented. Conclusion: The cost impact of HIV/AIDS to the health sector is undoubtedly high even though it is not easy to establish the cost of each service delivered to PLWA in Tanzania. As adopted in the present study, designers of methods for analysing impacts of diseases like this should consider a mixture of both quantitative and qualitative techniques. Meanwhile concerted measures are needed to improve health service record keeping so as enhancing data usability for research and rational management decision-making purposes."

This has however been due to limited options for dealing with the crisis of health personnel. There are on-going discussions in the country on whether to scale up task shifting as one of the strategies for addressing health personnel crisis. However, these discussions are not backed up by rigorous scientific evidence. The aim of this paper is two-fold. Firstly, to describe the current situation of implementing task shifting in the context of acute shortages of health workers and, secondly, to provide a descriptive account of the potential opportunities or benefits and the likely challenges which might ensue as a result of implementing task shifting.                                                 METHODS: We employed in-depth interviews with informants at the district level and supplemented the information with additional interviews with informants at the national level. Interviews focussed on the informants' practical experiences of implementing task shifting in their respective health facilities (district level) and their opinions regarding opportunities and challenges which might be associated with implementation of task shifting practices. At the national level, the main focus was on policy issues related to management of health personnel in the context of implementation of task shifting, in addition to seeking their opinions and perceptions regarding opportunities and challenges of implementing task shifting if formally adopted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RESULTS: Task shifting has been in practice for many years in Tanzania and has been perceived as an inevitable coping mechanism due to limited options for addressing health personnel shortages in the country. Majority of informants had the concern that quality of services is likely to be affected if appropriate policy infrastructures are not in place before formalising tasks shifting. There was also a perception that implementation of task shifting has ensured access to services especially in underserved remote areas. Professional discontent and challenges related to the management of health personnel policies were also perceived as important issues to consider when implementing task shifting practices. Additional resources for additional training and supervisory tasks were also considered important in the implementation of task shifting in order to make it deliver much the same way as it is for conventional modalities of delivering care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 CONCLUSIONS: Task shifting implementation occurs as an ad hoc coping mechanism to the existing shortages of health workers in many undeserved areas of the country, not just in the study site whose findings are reported in this paper. It is recommended that the most important thing to do now is not to determine whether task shifting is possible or effective but to define the limits of task shifting so as to reach a consensus on where it can have the strongest and most sustainable impact in the delivery of quality health services. Any action towards this end needs to be evidence-based."

In 6/22 (27.3%) deaths, blood cultures were positive for a pathogen, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and non-Typhi Salmonella predominating. Chest radiography was suspicious for bacterial/mycobacterial disease in 5/22 additional deaths. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria were more sensitive but less specific than WHO severe malaria criteria for predicting mortality. Malaria is overdiagnosed in adults with severe febrile illness and was not associated with mortality in the absence of co-infection in this high-incidence setting. Adults with severe febrile illness should be tested for malaria and HIV using rapid, sensitive tests. Early antibiotic use should be promoted.

Most vector control programmes aiming at controlling life-threatening mosquitoes rely on the use of chemical insecticides, mainly belonging to the pyrethroid class. However, resistance of mosquito populations to pyrethroids is increasing at a dramatic rate, threatening the efficacy of control programmes throughout insecticide-treated areas, where mosquito-borne diseases are still prevalent. In the absence of new insecticides and efficient alternative vector control methods, resistance management strategies are therefore critical, but these require a deep understanding of adaptive mechanisms underlying resistance. Although insecticide resistance mechanisms are intensively studied in mosquitoes, such adaptation is often considered as the unique result of the selection pressure caused by insecticides used for vector control. Indeed, additional environmental parameters, such as insecticides/pesticides usage in agriculture, the presence of anthropogenic or natural xenobiotics, and biotic interactions between vectors and other organisms, may affect both the overall mosquito responses to pyrethroids and the selection of resistance mechanisms. In this context, the present work aims at updating current knowledge on pyrethroid resistance mechanisms in mosquitoes and compiling available data, often from different research fields, on the impact of the environment on mosquito response to pyrethroids. Key environmental factors, such as the presence of urban or agricultural pollutants and biotic interactions between mosquitoes and their microbiome are discussed, and research perspectives to fill in knowledge gaps are suggested."

In Tanzania Mainland the disease contributes to 39.4% of the total OPD attendances. In terms of mortality, malaria is known to be responsible for more than one third of deaths among children of age below 5 years and also contributes for up to one fifth of deaths among pregnant women. This paper is based on a study conducted in a rural community along the shores of Lake Victoria in Mwanza region, North-Western Tanzania. The study explores reasons for scepticism and low uptake of insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs) that were promoted through social marketing strategy for malaria control prior to the introduction of long lasting nets (LLN). The paper breaks from traditional approach that tend to study low uptake of health interventions in terms of structural practical constraints--cost, accessibility, everyday priorities--or in terms of cognition--insufficient knowledge of benefits e.g. ignorance of public health messages. This paper has shown that, the majority of people who could afford the prices of ITNs and who knew where to obtain the insecticides did not necessarily buy them. This suggests that, although people tend to report cost-related factors as a barrier against the use of ITNs, there are other critical concerns at work. Without underestimating the practical factors, our study have recommended to consider critical examinations of those other concerns that hinder optimal utilization of ITN for malaria control, and the basis for those concerns."

OBJECTIVE: To obtain recorded incidence of childhood (age <5 years) TB in Mwanza Municipality, Tanzania, to estimate true incidence and to explore setting-specific reasons for differences. DESIGN: Recorded incidence of pediatric TB (2006 2010) was obtained from Mwanzan TB registries. Incident smear-positive pulmonary TB cases recruited from four TB clinics were used to estimate children exposed and the theoretical incidence of disease, assuming that either 10% or 23% of children would progress to disease following exposure. Reasons for underestimation were evaluated in the medical records of children who died at a secondary hospital. RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2010, 279 early childhood TB cases were recorded (TB incidence 63/100000/year). Over a 3-month period in 2011, 44% of smear-positive TB patients being treated in Mwanza were living with a total of 139 children. From census data, we estimated that 1279 children were exposed in Mwanza in 2011. Using estimates of the likelihood of disease progression, the theoretical incidence of early childhood TB ranged from 134.2 to 308.5/100000/year. CONCLUSIONS: The true burden of early childhood TB is likely much higher than recorded. Age-specific reporting, increasing clinical awareness and screening may reduce the magnitude of underdiagnosis in this vulnerable population."

METHODS: In a prospective study with a minimum follow-up of 12 months, 164 children with suspected tuberculosis were assigned to predefined diagnostic subgroups, based on microbiological and clinical findings. Results of smear microscopy and culture were compared against diagnostic performance of Xpert.                                                                                RESULTS:T wenty-eight of 164 children (17.1%) had confirmed tuberculosis. Xpert detected 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0%-100%) of smear-positive cases and 66.6% (95% CI, 43.0%-85.4%) of culture-positive but smear-negative cases. In the per-sample analysis, Xpert displayed a similar sensitivity (54.7% [95% CI, 42.7%-66.2%]) compared with culture methods. Xpert detected 3-fold more confirmed tuberculosis cases than smear microscopy but with equal rapidity. Four additional cases (8.5%) with clinical tuberculosis but negative culture were diagnosed by Xpert. Testing second and third samples increased sensitivity by 20% and an additional 16%, respectively. When tuberculosis was reliably excluded, Xpert's specificity was 100%. HIV infection did not affect diagnostic accuracy of Xpert.

The Pfhrp2 gene is highly polymorphic, with deletion of the entire gene reported in both laboratory and field isolates. These issues potentially confound the interpretation of PFHRP2 measurements. Studies designed to detect deletion of Pfhrp2 and its paralog Pfhrp3 were undertaken with samples from patients in seven countries contributing to the largest hospital-based severe malaria trial (AQUAMAT). The quantitative relationship between sequence polymorphism and PFHRP2 plasma concentration was examined in samples from selected sites in Mozambique and Tanzania. There was no evidence for deletion of either Pfhrp2 or Pfhrp3 in the 77 samples with lowest PFHRP2 plasma concentrations across the seven countries. Pfhrp2 sequence diversity was very high with no haplotypes shared among 66 samples sequenced. There was no correlation between Pfhrp2 sequence length or repeat type and PFHRP2 plasma concentration. These findings indicate that sequence polymorphism is not a significant cause of variation in PFHRP2 concentration in plasma samples from African children. This justifies the further development of plasma PFHRP2 concentration as a method for assessing African children who may have severe falciparum malaria. The data also add to the existing evidence base supporting the use of rapid diagnostic tests based on PFHRP2 detection."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of primary and acquired anti-TB drug resistance among newly diagnosed pulmonary TB (PTB) and relapse cases. Sputa were collected from newly diagnosed and relapse PTB patients. Drug susceptibility tests (DST) were performed on sputum culture positive isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using resistance ratio method on four first-line anti-TB drugs: rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and streptomycin. Demographic and anthropometric information was collected and HIV status was determined. Of the 523 culture positive isolates, DST results were available for 503 (96%), 455 were new and 48 were relapse cases. Resistance to at least one of the four drugs was observed in 7.8% (39/503) of the isolates, 7.3% (33/455) were new and 12.5% (6/48) were from relapse cases. Mono resistance to isoniazid was higher in both among new 45.5% (15/33) and relapse 50.0% (3/6) cases. Resistance to rifampicin and streptomycin alone was equal 4/33 (12.1%) and only among new cases. Resistance to ethambutol alone was only one among new cases. Overall MDR-TB prevalence was 2.4% (12/503), nine were new and three were relapse cases. MDR-TB was 17.9% (7/39) for rifampicin and isoniazid. Prevalence of HIV was 43.3% and was similar among new and relapse cases and not risk factor for drug resistance. Majority of PTB patients (52%) had BMI below 18 kg/m2. Those with BMI greater than 18 kg/m2 were more likely to develop drug resistance than those with BMI below 18 kg/m2 (P=0.004). With the resurgence of TB and the high prevalence of HIV among TB patients, prevalence of drug resistance is still low both among new and relapses cases. Despite the current low drug resistance, there is a need for continuous monitoring of the resistance."

Understanding the epidemiology and impact of HAT in such settings is difficult due to a lack of robust surveillance and reporting systems, restricting evidence-based policy development and contributing to the continued neglect of this disease.

METHODS:A rapid participatory appraisal (RPA) using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was conducted, that included key informant interviews, hospital record analysis, and tools adapted from participatory learning and action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RESULTS: Three villages adjacent to Ugala Game Reserve appeared to be the most affected. High levels of under-reporting were noted due to a lack of diagnostic tools at peripheral health care facilities and limited access to specialist services. Community stakeholders perceived the health and socio-economic burden of HAT to be similar to that of malaria.    CONCLUSION: The burden of HAT in remote rural communities is difficult to capture through routine surveillance systems alone. The RPA represents an efficient mechanism for engaging communities in public health action for trypanosomiasis control in northwest Tanzania."

Health Research Policy and Systems 9:43.",Quality assurance of qualitative research: a review of the discourse,Health Research ,Health Research Policy and Systems,2012,9,,43,,6,,,,,,,,,"Background: Increasing demand for qualitative research within global health has emerged alongside increasing demand for demonstration of quality of research, in line with the evidence-based model of medicine. In quantitative health sciences research, in particular clinical trials, there exist clear and widely-recognised guidelines for conducting quality assurance of research. However, no comparable guidelines exist for qualitative research and although there are long-standing debates on what constitutes 'quality' in qualitative research, the concept of 'quality assurance' has not been explored widely. In acknowledgement of this gap, we sought to review discourses around quality assurance of qualitative research, as a first step towards developing guidance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Methods: A range of databases, journals and grey literature sources were searched, and papers were included if they explicitly addressed quality assurance within a qualitative paradigm. A meta-narrative approach was used to review and synthesise the literature.                                                                                                                                                                        Results: Among the 37 papers included in the review, two dominant narratives were interpreted from the literature, reflecting contrasting approaches to quality assurance. The first focuses on demonstrating quality within research outputs; the second focuses on principles for quality practice throughout the research process. The second narrative appears to offer an approach to quality assurance that befits the values of qualitative research, emphasising the need to consider quality throughout the research process.                                          Conclusions: The paper identifies the strengths of the approaches represented in each narrative and recommend these are brought together in the development of a flexible framework to help qualitative researchers to define, apply and demonstrate principles of quality in their research."

Proportions of positive and indeterminate results, interferon (IFN)-c responses, interassay agreement and sensitivity were assessed. We found similar proportions of indeterminate results, levels of IFN-c and comparable sensitivity. The interassay agreement was moderate in all children (QFT-IT versus QFT-MT A: 85%, k50.44 and QFT-IT versus QFT-MT B: 88%, k50.50) and adults (QFT-IT versus QFT-MT A: 88%, k50.50 and QFT-IT versus QFT-MT B: 89%, k50.49). Sensitivity was low (QFT-IT 23%, QFTMT A 18% and B 19%) in children with confirmed or highly probable TB compared with adults (83%, 86% and 88%, respectively). The QFT-MT test can be reliably performed using less than one-third of the blood volume used in QFT-IT. The reduced volume may be useful for research and future diagnosis of paediatric TB. The poor sensitivity and high indeterminate rate of both IFN-c release assays in severely ill children, with immature or impaired immunity in an endemic setting, warrants further investigations"

This study was conducted using community-owned resource persons (CORPs) to provide early diagnosis and treatment of malaria, and collect data for estimation of malaria burden in four villages of Korogwe district, north-eastern Tanzania.                              Methods: In 2006, individuals with history of fever within 24 hours or fever (axillary temperature ?37.5°C) at presentation were presumptively treated using sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine. Between 2007 and 2010, individuals aged five years and above, with positive rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were treated with artemether/lumefantrine (AL) while under-fives were treated irrespective of RDT results. Reduction in anti-malarial consumption was determined by comparing the number of cases that would have been presumptively treated and those that were actually treated based on RDTs results. Trends of malaria incidence and slide positivity rates were compared between lowlands and highlands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Results: Of 15,729 cases attended, slide positivity rate was 20.4% and declined by >72.0% from 2008, reaching <10.0% from 2009 onwards; and the slide positivity rates were similar in lowlands and highlands from 2009 onwards. Cases with fever at presentation declined slightly, but remained at >40.0% in under-fives and >20.0% among individuals aged five years and above. With use of RDTs, cases treated with AL decreased from <58.0% in 2007 to <11.0% in 2010 and the numbers of adult courses saved were 3,284 and 1,591 in lowlands and highlands respectively. Malaria incidence declined consistently from 2008 onwards; and the highest incidence of malaria shifted from children aged <10?years to individuals aged 10–19?years from 2009.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Conclusions: With basic training, supervision and RDTs, CORPs successfully provided early diagnosis and treatment and reduced consumption of anti-malarials. Progressively declining malaria incidence and slide positivity rates suggest that all fever cases should be tested with RDTs before treatment. Data collected by CORPs was used to plan phase 1b MSP3 malaria vaccine trial and will be used for monitoring and evaluation of different health interventions. The current situation indicates that there is a remarkable changing pattern of malaria and these areas might be moving from control to pre-elimination levels."

Although reported condom use has increased in many African countries, there are often big differences by socioeconomic background. The aim of this study was to assess equity aspects of condom availability and uptake in three African districts to evaluate whether condom programmes are given sufficient priority.                                                                     Methods: Data on condom availability and use was examined in one district in Kenya, one in Tanzania and one in Zambia. The study was based on a triangulation of data collection methods in the three study districts: surveys in venues where people meet new sexual partners, population-based surveys and focus group discussions. The data was collected within an overall study on priority setting in health systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Results: At the time of the survey, condoms were observed in less than half of the high risk venues in two of the three districts and in 60% in the third district. Rural respondents in the population-based surveys perceived condoms to be less available and tended to be less likely to report condom use than urban respondents. Although focus group participants reported that condoms were largely available in their district, they expressed concerns related to the accessibility of free condoms.                                                                                                        Conclusion: As late as thirty years into the HIV epidemic there are still important gaps in the availability of condoms in places where people meet new sexual partners in these three African districts. Considering that previous studies have found that improved condom availability and accessibility in high risk places have a potential to increase condom use among people with multiple partners, the present study findings indicate that substantial further efforts should be made to secure that condoms are easily accessible in places where sexual relationships are initiated. Although condom distribution in drinking places has been pinpointed in the HIV/AIDS prevention strategies of all the three countries, its priority relative to other HIV/AIDS measures must be reassessed locally, nationally and regionally. In practical terms very clear supply chains of condoms to both formal and informal drinking places could make condom provision better and more reliable."

This is a prospective cross-sectional study. HIV-seropositive patients and immunocompetent controls from tuberculosis low and high-endemic countries were recruited. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (purified protein derivative; PPD)-specific CD4 T-cell responses were quantified directly from whole blood using flow-cytometric analysis of intracellular cytokines after specific stimulation. T-cell reactivity toward cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Staphylococcus aureus Enterotoxin B (SEB) served as control. In a low-endemic region, HIV-seropositive patients showed lower frequencies of PPD-specific T cells compared to immunocompetent individuals. This was not due to a general loss of immunity toward recall antigens, as T-cell immunity toward CMV or SEB was preserved. In line with continuous antigen exposure, HIV-seropositive patients from a high-endemic region showed preserved PPD-specific T-cell frequencies that were not different from those found in HIV-seronegative controls. Likewise, both groups did not differ in recall T-cell responses toward CMV or SEB. A lower prevalence and frequency of PPD-specific immunity is a typical feature of HIV-related immunosuppression in low-endemic regions. In contrast, PPD-specific responses are maintained in HIV-seropositive individuals in regions with high tuberculosis prevalence. This suggests constant skewing and restriction of specific T-cell immunity toward environmental antigens in HIV-seropositive individuals."

The use of animals for research and training in research centres, hospitals and schools is progressively increasing. Advances in biotechnology to improve animal productivity require animal research. Drugs being developed and new interventions or therapies being invented for cure and palliation of all sorts of animal diseases and conditions need to be tested in animals for their safety and efficacy at some stages of their development. Drugs and interventions for human use pass through a similar development process and must be tested pre-clinically in laboratory animals before clinical trials in humans can be conducted. Therefore, animals are important players in research processes which directly and indirectly benefit animals and humans. However, questions remain as to whether these uses of animals consider the best interests of animals themselves. Various research and training institutions in Tanzania have established some guidelines on animal use, including establishing animal ethics committees. However, most institutions have not established oversight committees. In institutions where there may be guidelines and policies, there are no responsible committees or units to directly oversee if and how these guidelines and policies are enforced; thus, implementation becomes difficult or impossible. This paper endeavours to raise some issues associated with the responsible use of animals in research and training in Tanzania and highlights suggestions for improvement of deficiencies that exist in order to bridge the gap between what ought to be practised and what is practised."

In Tanzania, the policy of decentralization and the health sector reform place an emphasis on community participation in making decisions in health care. However, aspects that can influence an individual’s opportunity to be listened to and to contribute to discussion have been researched to a very limited extent in low-income settings. The objective of this study was to explore challenges to fair decision-making processes in health care services with a special focus on the potential influence of gender, wealth, ethnicity and education.

Conclusion: Earlier diagnoses through expanded HIV testing may reduce high mortality and attrition rates if combined with better patient tracing systems. Further research is needed to explore reasons for attrition."

Recently, an immunogenic Anopheles gambiae salivary protein (gSG6) was identified and proposed as the basis of an immuno-assay determining exposure to Afrotropical malaria vectors. In the present study, IgG responses to gSG6 and 6 malaria antigens (CSP, AMA-1, MSP-1, MSP-3, GLURP R1, and GLURP R2) were compared to Anopheles exposure and malaria incidence in a cohort of children from Korogwe district, Tanzania, an area of moderate and heterogeneous malaria transmission. Anti-gSG6 responses above the threshold for seropositivity were detected in 15% (96/636) of the children, and were positively associated with geographical variations in Anopheles exposure (OR 1.25, CI 1.01–1.54, p?=?0.04). Additionally, IgG responses to gSG6 in individual children showed a strong positive association with household level mosquito exposure. IgG levels for all antigens except AMA-1 were associated with the frequency of malaria episodes following sampling. gSG6 seropositivity was strongly positively associated with subsequent malaria incidence (test for trend p?=?0.004), comparable to malaria antigens MSP-1 and GLURP R2. Our results show that the gSG6 assay is sensitive to micro-epidemiological variations in exposure to Anopheles mosquitoes, and provides a correlate of malaria risk that is unrelated to immune protection. While the technique requires further evaluation in a range of malaria endemic settings, our findings suggest that the gSG6 assay may have a role in the evaluation and planning of targeted and preventative anti-malaria interventions."

Consequently, Tanzania is striving to scale-up safe medical male circumcision to reduce HIV transmission. However, there is a need to investigate the perceptions of male circumcision in Tanzania using specific populations. The purpose of the present study was to assess the perceptions of male circumcision in a cohort of police officers that also served as a source of volunteers for a phase I/II HIV vaccine (HIVIS-03) trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.                                                                                                            Methods: In-depth interviews with 24 men and 10 women were conducted. Content analysis informed by the socio-ecological model was used to analyze the data.                                        Results: Informants perceived male circumcision as a health-promoting practice that may prevent HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted infections. They reported male circumcision promotes sexual pleasure, confidence and hygiene or sexual cleanliness. They added that it is a religious ritual and a cultural practice that enhances the recognition of manhood in the community. However, informants were concerned about the cost involved in male circumcision and cleanliness of instruments used in medical and traditional male circumcision. They also expressed confusion about the shame of undergoing circumcision at an advanced age and pain that could emanate after circumcision. The participants advocated for health policies that promote medical male circumcision at childhood, specifically along with the vaccination program.                                                                                          Conclusions: The perceived benefit of male circumcision as a preventive strategy to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is important. However, there is a need to ensure that male circumcision is conducted under hygienic conditions. Integrating male circumcision service in the routine childhood vaccination program may increase its coverage at early childhood. The findings from this investigation provide contextual understanding that may assist in scaling-up male circumcision in Tanzania."

Data from the largest randomized, controlled trial for the treatment of children hospitalized with severe malaria were used to identify such predictors of a poor outcome from severe malaria.Methods.African children (<15 years) with severe malaria participated in a randomized comparison of parenteral artesunate and parenteral quinine in 9 African countries. Detailed clinical assessment was performed on admission. Parasite densities were assessed in a reference laboratory. Predictors of death were examined using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results. Twenty indicators of disease severity were assessed, out of which 5 (base deficit, impaired consciousness, convulsions, elevated blood urea, and underlying chronic illness) were associated independently with death. Tachypnea, respiratory distress, deep breathing, shock, prostration, low pH, hyperparasitemia, severe anemia, and jaundice were statistically significant indicators of death in the univariate analysis but not in the multivariate model. Age, glucose levels, axillary temperature, parasite density, heart rate, blood pressure, and blackwater fever were not related to death in univariate models. Conclusions. Acidosis, cerebral involvement, renal impairment, and chronic illness are key independent predictors for a poor outcome in African children with severe malaria.

", Evidence for in vitro and in vivo expression of the conserved VAR3 (type 3) Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1, Malaria ,Malaria Journal ,2012,11,1,129,,10,,,,,,,,,"Members of the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesion antigen family are major contributors to the pathogenesis of P. falciparum malaria infections. The PfEMP1-encoding var genes are among the most diverse sequences in nature, but three genes, var1, var2csa and var3 are found conserved in most parasite genomes. The most severe forms of malaria disease are caused by parasites expressing a subset of antigenically conserved PfEMP1 variants. Thus the ubiquitous and conserved VAR3 PfEMP1 is of particular interest to the research field. Evidence of VAR3 expression on the infected erythrocyte surface has never been presented, and var3 genes have been proposed to be transcribed and expressed differently from the rest of the var gene family members. In this study, parasites expressing VAR3 PfEMP1 were generated using anti-VAR3 antibodies and the var transcript and PfEMP1 expression profiles of the generated parasites were investigated. The IgG reactivity by plasma from children living in malaria-endemic Tanzania was tested to parasites and recombinant VAR3 protein. Parasites from hospitalized children were isolated and the transcript level of var3 was investigated. Var3 is transcribed and its protein product expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes. The VAR3-expressing parasites were better recognized by children´s IgG than a parasite line expressing a Group B var gene. Two in 130 children showed increased recognition of parasites expressing VAR3 and to the recombinant VAR3 protein after a malaria episode and the isolated parasites showed high levels of var3 transcripts. Collectively, the presented data suggest that var3 is transcribed and its protein product expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes in the same manner as seen for other var genes both in vitro and in vivo. Only very few children exhibit seroconversion to VAR3 following a malaria episode requiring hospitalization, supporting the previous conclusion drawn from var3 transcript analysis of parasites collected from children hospitalized with malaria, that VAR3 is not associated with severe anaemia or cerebral malaria syndromes in children."

Mass distribution campaigns are being used to rapidly increase net coverage in at-risk populations.

Methods: In 2011 two cross-sectional household surveys were conducted in 50 clusters in Muleba district, north-west Tanzania. Prior to the UCC 3,246 households were surveyed and 2,499 afterwards. Data on bed net ownership and usage, demographics of household members and household characteristics including factors related to socio-economic status were gathered, using an adapted version of the standard Malaria Indicator Survey. Specific questions relating to the UCC process were asked.

ITN usage in all residents rose from 40.8% to 55.7%. After the UCC 58.4% (95% CI?=?54.7-62.1) of households had sufficient ITNs to cover all their sleeping places. Households with children under five years (OR?=?2.4, 95% CI?=?1.9-2.9) and small households (OR?=?1.9, 95% CI?=?1.5-2.4) were most likely to reach universal coverage.

Journal of Health Population and Nutrition 30(1):31-40.","Perceptions about probiotic yogurt for health and nutrition in the context of HIV/AIDS in Mwanza, Tanzania", HIV/AIDS,Journal of Health Population and Nutrition ,2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Recently, the food and malnutrition issues have taken centre stage within the arena of HIV/AIDS epidemic, with several calls being made for context-specific health and nutrition interventions to deal with the emerging food insecurity and malnutrition issues in settings with high burdens of HIV/AIDS. The use of probiotics as nutritional supplements in HIV/AIDS-affected and resource-poor settings has also been advocated. This paper presents the results of a qualitative study on community knowledge and perceptions about probiotics and their potential impact on people's everyday life in the context of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In-depth interviews (n=26) were conducted with residents in Mwanza, Tanzania. The results showed that people living with HIV/AIDS, who were using probiotic yogurt produced through a joint partnership of Western Heads East, Tanzania Medical Research Institute and the Tukwamune Women's Group, reported perceived beneficial effects, such as gain in weight and improved health and well-being. Yet, these beneficial effects might be resulting in growing misconceptions about probiotic yogurt being ‘medicine’ for the treatment of HIV/AIDS; this is leading some people living with HIV/AIDS to abandon taking their antiretroviral medications based on the view that the probiotic yogurt is making them feel much better. The findings illustrate the potential challenges with regard to the introduction of nutritional food supplements into new contexts plagued by malnutrition and infectious diseases. Public-health education and awareness programmes are needed when introducing novel foods into such contexts."

METHODS:Data on voluntary counselling and testing and ART use among HIV-infected persons were analysed from Karonga (Malawi), Kisesa (Tanzania), Masaka (Uganda) and Manicaland (Zimbabwe), where free ART provision started between 2004 and 2007. ART coverage was compared across sites by calculating the proportion on ART among those estimated to need treatment, by age, sex and educational attainment. Logistic regression was used to identify socio-demographic characteristics associated with undergoing eligibility screening at an ART clinic within 2 years of being diagnosed with HIV, for three sites with information on diagnosis and screening dates.                                                                                          RESULTS: Among adults known to be HIV-infected from serological surveys, the proportion who knew their HIV status was 93% in Karonga, 37% in Kisesa, 46% in Masaka and 25% in Manicaland. Estimated ART coverage was highest in Masaka (68%) and lowest in Kisesa (2%). The proportion of HIV-diagnosed persons who were screened for ART eligibility within 2 years of diagnosis ranged from 14% in Kisesa to 84% in Masaka, with the probability of screening uptake increasing with age at diagnosis in all sites.                                            CONCLUSIONS: Higher HIV testing rates among HIV-infected persons in the community do not necessarily correspond with higher uptake of ART, nor more equitable treatment coverage among those in need of treatment. In all sites, young adults tend to be disadvantaged in terms of accessing and initiating ART, even after accounting for their less urgent need."

Methods: A new approach to estimating ART need is developed based on calculating age-specific proportions of HIV-infected adults expected to die within a fixed number of years in the absence of treatment. Mortality data for HIV-infected adults in the pre-treatment era from five African HIV cohort studies were combined to construct a life table, starting at age 15, smoothed with a Weibull model. Assuming that ART should be made available to anyone expected to die within 3 years, conditional 3-year survival probabilities were computed to represent proportions needing ART. The build-up of ART need in a successful programme continuously recruiting infected adults into treatment as they age to within 3 years of expected death was represented by annually extending the conditional survival range.                                                                                                                                                                                                   Results: The Weibull model: survival probability in the infected state from age 15 = exp(?0.0073 × (age ? 15)1.69) fitted the pooled age-specific mortality data very closely. Initial treatment need for infected persons increased rapidly with age, from 15% at age 20–24 to 32% at age 40–44 and 42% at age 60–64. Overall need in the treatment of naïve population was 24%, doubling within 5 years in a programme continually recruiting patients entering the high-risk period for dying.

METHODS: From March 2009 through January 2011, we enrolled 15,460 children in two age categories--6 to 12 weeks of age and 5 to 17 months of age--for vaccination with either RTS,S/AS01 or a non-malaria comparator vaccine. The primary end point of the analysis was vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria during the 12 months after vaccination in the first 6000 children 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment who received all three doses of vaccine according to protocol. After 250 children had an episode of severe malaria, we evaluated vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in both age categories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  RESULTS: In the 14 months after the first dose of vaccine, the incidence of first episodes of clinical malaria in the first 6000 children in the older age category was 0.32 episodes per person-year in the RTS,S/AS01 group and 0.55 episodes per person-year in the control group, for an efficacy of 50.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45.8 to 54.6) in the intention-to-treat population and 55.8% (97.5% CI, 50.6 to 60.4) in the per-protocol population. Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria was 45.1% (95% CI, 23.8 to 60.5) in the intention-to-treat population and 47.3% (95% CI, 22.4 to 64.2) in the per-protocol population. Vaccine efficacy against severe malaria in the combined age categories was 34.8% (95% CI, 16.2 to 49.2) in the per-protocol population during an average follow-up of 11 months. Serious adverse events occurred with a similar frequency in the two study groups. Among children in the older age category, the rate of generalized convulsive seizures after RTS,S/AS01 vaccination was 1.04 per 1000 doses (95% CI, 0.62 to 1.64).

This gives potential for measurement error and undermines meta-analyses of adverse effects. We undertook to identify barriers to accurate and complete reporting of harms data, by qualitatively exploring participants’ experiences of illness and treatment, and reporting behaviors; and compared the number and nature of data detected by three enquiry metho  Methods: Participants within antiretroviral/antimalarial interaction trials in South Africa and Tanzania were asked about medical history, treatments and/or adverse events by general enquiries followed by checklists. Those reporting differently between these two question methods were invited to an in-depth interview and focus group discussion. Health narratives were analysed to investigate accuracy and completeness of case record form data and to understand reasons for differential reporting between question methods. Outcomes were the number and nature of data by question method, themes from qualitative analyses and a theoretical interpretation of participants’ experiences.                                                                                          Results: We observed a cumulative increase in sensitivity of detection of all types of reports while progressing from general enquiry, through checklist, to in-depth interview. Questioning detail and terminology influenced participants’ recognition of health issues and treatments. Reporting patterns and vocabulary suggest influence from the relative importance that illnesses and treatments have for participants. Perceptions were often dichotomised (e.g. ‘street’ versus clinic treatments, symptoms experienced versus tests and examinations performed, chronic versus acute illness, persistent versus intermittent symptoms, activity- versus malaria-related symptoms) and this differentiation extended to ideas of relevance to report. South African participants displayed a ‘trial citizenship’, taking responsibility for the impact of their reporting on trial results, and even reaching reporting decisions by consensus. In contrast, Tanzanians perceived their role more as patients than participants; the locus of responsibility for knowing information relevant to the trial fell with trial staff as doctors rather than with themselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Conclusions: Our observations of how reporting relates to participant perceptions inside and outside trials could help optimise how harms data are elicited. Questions reflecting the different ways that biomedically defined illness and treatment data are perceived by participants may help them understand relevance for reporting. We will theorise how these two disparate trial environments may have influenced how participants understood their role, as this could help researchers achieve empowered participation in similar trials."

METHODS : After baseline household and health facility surveys in 2004, five districts comprising 24 divisions were randomly assigned either to receive IPTi (n = 12) or not (n = 12). Implementation started in March 2005, led by routine health services with support from the research team. In 2007, a large household survey was undertaken to assess the impact of IPTi on survival in infants aged two-11 months through birth history interviews with all women aged 13-49 years. The analysis is based on an ""intention-to-treat"" ecological design, with survival outcomes analysed according to the cluster in which the mothers lived                                                                                                        .                                                                             RESULTS: Survival in infants aged two-11 months was comparable in IPTi and comparison areas at baseline. In intervention areas in 2007, 48% of children aged 12-23 months had documented evidence of receiving three doses of IPTi, compared to 2% in comparison areas (P < 0.0001). Over the three years of the study there was a marked improvement in survival in both groups. Between 2001-4 and 2005-7, mortality rates in two-11 month olds fell from 34.1 to 23.6 per 1,000 person-years in intervention areas and from 32.3 to 20.7 in comparison areas. In 2007, divisions implementing IPTi had a 14% (95% CI -12%, 49%) higher mortality rate in two-11 month olds in comparison with non-implementing divisions (P = 0.31).                 CONCLUSION: The lack of evidence of an effect of IPTi on survival could be a false negative result due to a lack of power or imbalance of unmeasured confounders. Alternatively, there could be no mortality impact of IPTi due to low coverage, late administration, drug resistance, decreased malaria transmission or improvements in vector control and case management. This study raises important questions for programme evaluation design."

METHODS: We measured, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antibodies to 4 Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens (AMA-1, MSP-1(42), EBA-175, and MSP-3) and by growth inhibitory activity (GIA) using 2 parasite clones (FV0 and 3D7) at 4 times on 860 children who were randomized to receive with RTS,S/AS01(E) or a control vaccine.                                     RESULTS: Antibody concentrations to AMA-1, EBA-175, and MSP-1(42) decreased with age during the first year of life, then increased to 32 months of age. Anti-MSP-3 antibody concentrations gradually increased, and GIA gradually decreased up to 32 months. Vaccination with RTS,S/AS01(E) resulted in modest reductions in AMA-1, EBA-175, MSP-1(42), and MSP-3 antibody concentrations and no significant change in GIA. Increasing anti-merozoite antibody concentrations and GIA were prospectively associated with increased risk of clinical malaria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with RTS,S/AS01E reduces exposure to blood-stage parasites and, thus, reduces anti-merozoite antigen antibody concentrations. However, in this study, these antibodies were not correlates of clinical immunity to malaria. Instead, heterogeneous exposure led to confounded, positive associations between increasing antibody concentration and increasing risk of clinical malaria."

IL-4, IL-5 and IFN? responses were associated with being infection negative in 1996 whereas IL-10 responses were associated with being infection positive. Similarly, specific IgG3 and IgE were strongly associated with being infection negative in 1996 whereas specific IgG4, and thus high IgG4/IgE ratios, were strongly associated with being infection positive. Intermediary levels of mainly IL-5, IFN? and PBMC stimulation indices were observed for study individuals who changed from being infection positive in 1975 to infection negative in 1996, or vice versa, suggesting a transition in cellular immunoresponsiveness associated with changing infection status. The findings suggest that some people are more disposed to infection with bancroftian filariasis than others and that this is largely unaffected by treatment with DEC. The findings also suggest that specific cellular and antibody responses are more related to current than past infection status, and that IL-4, IL-5, IFN?, specific IgG3 and IgE are associated with parasite clearance, whereas IL-10 and specific IgG4 are associated with parasite protection."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of ParaHit and OptiMAL tests for detection of malaria infections as compared with routine microscopy. This facility-based study was carried out in Mwanza, north-western Tanzania and involved outpatients attending Igoma Health Centre. Blood samples were tested for malaria infection using the two RDTs and compared with Giemsa stained blood films examined using microscope. A total of 243 individuals (median age= 22 years) were involved in the study. Microscopy had a higher detection rate of 19.7% (48/243) as compared to ParaHit (4.5%) and OptiMAL (3.7%). Low sensitivity of 21.2% and 17%, but high specificity of 99.4% for ParaHit and OptiMAL, respectively was observed. Of all positive blood slides for Plasmodium falciparum, 78.7% had low parasite density (80 -720 parasite/microl of blood). These slides were negative for malaria parasite for both RDTs. Over 80% of study participants who reported fever had negative blood slides for malaria parasites by microscopy. On the other hand, 44.7% of those who reported no fever had positive blood slides for P. falciparum. Study participants who reported to have fever and high parasite density above 720 parasite/ microl were likely to be positive by both RDTs (OR= 6.8; P= 0.031529). In conclusion, the overall performance of both RDTs in detecting asexual P. falciparum was low as compared to microscopy and their performance were highly affected by parasite density. This calls for further evaluation studies before RDTs are widely used in peripheral health facilities in order to minimize potential severe consequences."

In 2007, 15% (1.37 million) of the tuberculosis cases were HIV-positive tuberculosis (TB). This cross-sectional study was conducted in February 2009 to assess the effect of the level of CD4 lymphocyte counts on the development of smear positive pulmonary TB (PTB) among HIV patients before and after initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). A total of 155 HIV patients who were on HAART programme were enrolled and out of these 42 (27.1%) were smear positive PTB. Of the 42 PTB patients, 38 (90.5%) were also infected with HIV and were already at initiation of HAART. There was no association between the development of smear positive PTB and socio-demographic characteristics among HIV patients before and after HAART initiation (P>0.05). A larger proportion of HIV+PTB patients diagnosed before and after HAART initiation was found with CD4 lymphocyte count <200cells/microl. However, the difference was not statistically significant (P =0.092). Among HIV patients who were diagnosed to be smear positive PTB after HAART initiation, their CD4 lymphocyte counts at time of TB diagnosis was lower than their CD4 lymphocyte counts at time of HAART initiation. The four patients diagnosed with PTB after HAART initiation had mean CD4 lymphocyte counts at HAART initiation not statistically different from that at TB diagnosis (t=0.715, P=0.526). The median time period within which the diagnosis of smear positive PTB was made after HAART initiation was 22 weeks and the mean time was 66.75 weeks. These findings provide evidence that development of smear positive PTB after HAART initiation may occur at any level of CD4 lymphocyte count (P<0.05). This study was limited by the relatively small sample size, we therefore recommend more studies involving a larger sample size in order to estimate more accurately the effect of both level of CD4 lymphocyte count and HAART on the development of smear positive PTB among HIV patients on treatment."

Only twenty five (41.0%) clinicians considered malaria microscopy results from their respective laboratories to be reliable. Forty-five (73.8%) clinicians reported to have been satisfied with malaria diagnostic services provided by their respective laboratories. Majority (90.2%, N = 679) of the patients or care-takers were satisfied with the laboratory services. The findings show that laboratory personnel were not satisfied with the prevailing working conditions, which were reported to undermine laboratory performance. It was evident that there was no standard criteria for ordering malaria laboratory tests and test results were under-utilized. Majority of the clinicians and patients or care-takers were comfortable with the overall performance of laboratories, but laboratory results were having less impact on patient management"

This paper presents a conceptual model outlining ways in which SES may influence malaria-related outcomes. Building on this conceptual model, we use household data from rural Mvomero, Tanzania, to examine empirical relationships among multiple measures of household and individual SES and demographics, on the one hand, and malaria prevention, illness, and diagnosis and treatment behaviours, on the other. We find that access to prevention and treatment is significantly associated with indicators of households' wealth; education-based disparities do not emerge in this context. Meanwhile, reported malaria illness shows a stronger association with demographic variables than with SES (controlling for prevention). Greater understanding of the mechanisms through which SES and malaria policies interact to influence disease risk can help to reduce health disparities and reduce the malaria burden in an equitable manner"

Data were analysed using cluster-level methods for stratified cluster-randomised trials, using interaction tests to determine if intervention impact differed by subgroup.                                                                                                       RESULTS:Taking into account multiplicity of testing, concurrence with a priori hypotheses and consistency within the results no strong effect-modifiers emerged. Impact on pregnancy knowledge and reported attitudes to sex increased with years of exposure to high-quality intervention.                                                                                                                                    CONCLUSIONS: The desirable long-term impact of the MEMA kwa Vijana intervention did not vary greatly according to the subgroups examined. This suggests that the intervention can have an impact on a broad cross-section of young people in rural Mwanza."

However, their potential has not been realised due to their limited knowledge and misconceptions surrounding HIV, which could be addressed through training of VAC members. In an attempt to increase HIV knowledge levels and address common misconceptions amongst the VACs, an HIV curriculum was delivered to members in rural north western Tanzania.                                                                                      METHODS: An evaluation of HIV knowledge was conducted prior to and post-delivery of HIV training sessions, within members of three VACs in Kisesa ward. Quantitative surveys were used with several open-ended questions to identify local misconceptions and evaluate HIV knowledge levels. Short educational training sessions covering HIV transmission, prevention and treatment were conducted, with each VAC using quizzes, role-plays and participatory learning and action tools. Post-training surveys occurred up to seven days after the final training session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        RESULTS: Before the training, ""good"" HIV knowledge was higher amongst men than women (p = 0.041), and among those with previous HIV education (p = 0.002). The trade-centre had a faster turn-over of VAC members, and proximity to the trade-centre was associated with a shorter time on the committee.Training improved HIV knowledge levels with more members achieving a ""good"" score in the post-training survey compared with the baseline survey (p = < 0.001). The training programme was popular, with 100% of participants requesting further HIV training in the future and 51.7% requesting training at three-monthly intervals.                                                                                                                                                                         CONCLUSIONS:In this setting, a series of HIV training sessions for VACs demonstrated encouraging results, with increased HIV knowledge levels following short educational sessions. Further work is required to assess the success of VAC members in disseminating this HIV education to their communities, as well as up-scaling this pilot study to other regions in Tanzania with different misconceptions."

However, the role of diabetes for TB has not been assessed in populations where HIV is prevalent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Methods :A case-control study was conducted in an urban population in Tanzania among culture-confirmed pulmonary TB patients and non-TB neighborhood controls. Participants were tested for diabetes according to WHO guidelines and serum concentrations of acute phase reactants were measured. The association between diabetes and TB, and the role of HIV as an effect modifier, were examined using logistic regression. Since blood glucose levels increase during the acute phase response, we adjusted for elevated serum acute phase reactants.        Results: Among 803 cases and 350 controls the mean (SD) age was 34.8 (11.9) and 33.8 (12.0) years, and the prevalence of diabetes was 16.7% (95% CI: 14.2; 19.4) and 9.4% (6.6; 13.0), respectively. Diabetes was associated with TB (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.5; 3.4, p<0.001). However, the association depended on HIV status (interaction, p?=?0.01) due to a stronger association among HIV uninfected (OR 4.2, 95% CI: 1.5; 11.6, p?=?0.01) compared to HIV infected (OR 0.1, 95% CI: 0.01; 1.8, p?=?0.13) after adjusting for age, sex, demographic factors and elevated serum acute phase reactants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Conclusion:Diabetes is a risk factor for TB in HIV uninfected, whereas the association in HIV infected patients needs further study. The increasing diabetes prevalence may be a threat to TB control"

To optimize such impact, several interventions have been suggested, including recognition of TM's economic and medical worth at academic and health policy levels; establishing working relationships with those prescribing TM; providing evidence for safety and effectiveness of local TM through appropriate studies with malaria patients; spreading results for clinical recommendations and health policy development; implementing and evaluating results of new health policies that officially integrate TM."

However, parasites resistant to SP are widespread in parts of Africa, and IPTp may perversely exacerbate placental infections that contain SP-resistant parasites.                        METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design. We determined IPTp use in a delivery cohort of 880 pregnant women in Muheza, Tanzania, by report and by plasma sulfa measurements, and we examined its effects on maternal and fetal delivery outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                  RESULTS: In the overall cohort, IPTp was not associated with decreased odds of placental malaria or with increased mean maternal hemoglobin or mean birth weight. Unexpectedly, IPTp was associated with decreased cord hemoglobin level and increased risk of fetal anemia, which may be related to in utero SP exposure.                                                                            CONCLUSIONS: IPTp does not improve overall pregnancy outcomes in Muheza, Tanzania, where SP-resistant parasites predominate and may increase the odds of fetal anemia. As parasite resistance increases in a community, the overall effect of IPTp may transition from net benefit to neutral or net harm."

RESULTS:A Weight loss (48.3%) and chronic cough (40.8 %) were the most reported manifestations in the study population. More than 50% of patients presented with CD4?200. Most symptoms were found to be highly sensitive (71% to 93%) in predicting severe immunosuppression using CD4<200 cut-off point as a 'Gold standard'. Chronic diarrhoea presented in 10.6%, and predicted well severe immunosuppression either alone (OR 1.95, 95%CI, 0.95-4.22) or in combination (OR 4.21, 95%CI 0.92-19.33) with other symptoms. Basing strictly on WHO clinical staging 30.8% of patients were detected to be severely immunosuppressed (Stage 4). While using our proposed management categories of severe and moderate immunosuppression 70% of patients were put into the severe immunosuppression group, consistent with CD4 cut-off count of?350.

This study was conducted in areas with declining malaria burden to assess; 1) the accuracy of RDTs when used at different community settings, 2) the impact of using RDTs on anti-malarial dispensing by community-owned resource persons (CORPs) and 3) adherence of CORPs to treatment guidelines by providing treatment based on RDT results.                                                                                                                                                                      Methods: Data were obtained from: 1) a longitudinal study of passive case detection of fevers using CORPs in six villages in Korogwe; and 2) cross-sectional surveys (CSS) in six villages of Korogwe and Muheza districts, north-eastern, Tanzania. Performance of RDTs was compared with microscopy as a gold standard, and factors affecting their accuracy were explored using a multivariate logistic regression model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Results: Overall sensitivity and specificity of RDTs in the longitudinal study (of 23,793 febrile cases; 18,154 with microscopy and RDTs results) were 88.6% and 88.2%, respectively. In the CSS, the sensitivity was significantly lower (63.4%; ?2 = 367.7, p < 0.001), while the specificity was significantly higher (94.3%; ?2 = 143.1, p < 0.001) when compared to the longitudinal study. As determinants of sensitivity of RDTs in both studies, parasite density of < 200 asexual parasites/?l was significantly associated with high risk of false negative RDTs (OR?16.60, p < 0.001), while the risk of false negative test was significantly lower among cases with fever (axillary temperature ?37.5°C) (OR ? 0.63, p ? 0.027). The risk of false positive RDT (as a determinant of specificity) was significantly higher in cases with fever compared to afebrile cases (OR?2.40, p < 0.001). Using RDTs reduced anti-malarials dispensing from 98.9% to 32.1% in cases aged ?5 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Conclusion: Although RDTs had low sensitivity and specificity, which varied widely depending on fever and parasite density, using RDTs reduced over-treatment with anti-malarials significantly. Thus, with declining malaria prevalence, RDTs will potentially identify majority of febrile cases with parasites and lead to improved management of malaria and non-malaria fevers."

Although continued molecular surveillance of malaria parasites is important to early identify emerging anti-malarial drug resistance, it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain parasite samples from ongoing studies, such as routine drug efficacy trials. To explore other sources of parasite DNA, this study was conducted to examine if sufficient DNA could be successfully extracted from malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), used and collected as part of routine case management services in health facilities, and thus forming the basis for molecular analyses, surveillance and quality control (QC) testing of RDTs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     METHODS:One hyper-parasitaemic blood sample (131,260 asexual parasites/?l) was serially diluted in triplicates with whole blood and blotted on RDTs. DNA was extracted from the RDT dilution series, either immediately or after storage for one month at room temperature. The extracted DNA was amplified using a nested PCR method for Plasmodium species detection. Additionally, 165 archived RDTs obtained from ongoing malaria studies were analysed to determine the amplification success and test applicability of RDT for QC testingRESULTS: DNA was successfully extracted and amplified from the three sets of RDT dilution series and the minimum detection limit of PCR was <1 asexual parasite/?l. DNA was also successfully amplified from (1) 70/71 (98.6%) archived positive RDTs (RDTs and microscopy positive) (2) 52/63 (82.5%) false negative RDTs (negative by RDTs but positive by microscopy) and (3) 4/24 (16.7%) false positive RDTs (positive by RDTs but negative by microscopy). Finally, 7(100%) negative RDTs (negative by RDTs and microscopy) were also negative by PCR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                CONCLUSION: This study showed that DNA extracted from archived RDTs can be successfully amplified by PCR and used for detection of malaria parasites. Since Tanzania is planning to introduce RDTs in all health facilities (and possibly also at community level), availability of archived RDTs will provide an alternative source of DNA for genetic studies such as continued surveillance of parasite resistance to anti-malarial drugs. The DNA obtained from RDTs can also be used for QC testing by detecting malaria parasites using PCR in places without facilities for microscopy."

This study was conducted to characterize Anopheles gambiae s.l. and determine pyrethroid resistance profiles relative to physicochemical properties of breeding habitats in Accra, Ghana. Eight aquatic habitats containing Anopheles larvae were identified and from each habitat, larvae and water were sampled. Adult An. gambiae reared from larvae were morphologically identified and tested for permethrin (0.75%) and deltamethrin (0.05%) resistance using WHO bioassay method. An. gambiae s.s. found were identified to their molecular levels and kdr mutation detected using PCR-based methods. Twenty-nine physicochemical parameters of each water sample were measured and their levels connected with pyrethroid resistance and proportions of An. gambiae s.s. molecular forms in habitats. A total of 2,257 mosquitoes were morphologically identified as An. gambiae s.l. and all 224 processed for PCR were identified as An. gambiae s.s., of which 56.46% and 43.54% were M and S-forms, respectively. Both forms occurred in sympatry in all larval habitats and no S/M hybrids were detected. However, M-form larvae were in high proportion in polluted habitats than the S-form. An. gambiae s.s. was highly resistant to both deltamethrin and permethrin with mortality rates of 42.98-70.0% and 6.5-20.0% respectively. The frequency of kdr mutation was 60.5 % (n=195). This mutation occurred in both S and M-forms, but was mainly associated with the S-form (X2=10.92, df =1, P=0.001). Carbonate and pH were both selected in discriminant function analysis as best predictors of high proportion of M-form in the habitats. The adaptation of An. gambiae s.s. in polluted aquatic habitats coupled with occurrence of insecticide resistance is quite alarming particularly for urban malaria control and needs further exploration in a wider context."

Control efforts against these vectors in Tanzania like in most other Sub Saharan countries have failed to achieve the set objectives of eliminating transmission due to scarcity of information about the enormous diversity of Anopheles mosquito species and their susceptibility status to insecticides used for malaria vector control. Understanding the diversity and insecticide susceptibility status of these vectors and other factors relating to their importance as vectors (such as malaria transmission dynamics, vector biology, ecology, behaviour and population genetics) is crucial to developing a better and sound intervention strategies that will reduce man-vector contact and also manage the emergency of insecticide resistance early and hence .a success in malaria control. The objective of this review was therefore to obtain the information from published and unpublished documents on spatial distribution and composition of malaria vectors, key features of their behaviour, transmission indices and susceptibility status to insecticides in Tanzania. All data available were collated into a database. Details recorded for each data source were the locality, latitude/longitude, time/period of study, species, abundance, sampling/collection methods, species identification methods, insecticide resistance status, including evidence of the kdr allele, and Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite rate. This collation resulted in a total of 368 publications, encompassing 806,273 Anopheles mosquitoes from 157 georeferenced locations being collected and identified across Tanzania from 1950s to 2010. Overall, the vector species most often reported included An. gambiae complex (66.8%), An. funestus complex (21.8%), An. gambiae s.s. (2.1%) and An. arabiensis (9%). A variety of sampling/ collection and species identification methods were used with an increase in molecular techniques in recent decades. Only 32.2% and 8.4% of the data sets reported on sporozoite analysis and entomological inoculation rate (EIR), respectively which highlights the paucity of such important information in the country. Studies demonstrated efficacy of all four major classes of insecticides against malaria vectors in Tanzania with focal points showing phenotypic resistance. About 95% of malaria entomological data was obtained from northeastern Tanzania. This shows the disproportionate nature of the available information with the western part of the country having none. Therefore it is important for the country to establish entomological surveillance system with state of the art to capture all vitally important entomological indices including vector bionomics in areas of Tanzania where very few or no studies have been done. This is vital in planning and implementing evidence based malaria vector control programmes as well as in monitoring the current malaria control interventions."

The aim was to obthin demographic and epidemiological indices to be used in the evaluation of health related interventions which have been undertaken in the area. Period covered is up to December 2010. Baseline survey was conducted in 14 villages of Korogwe district in October 2005 and DSS was launched in January 2006 years. Demographic, social economic status, immunisation coverage and birth history data was collected during the follow-up and each household was visited every 4 months. Estimates of mortality levels were derived from deaths that were collected during household visits. Birth history data were used to estimate the lifetime and period fertility of women aged 15-49 years. Estimates of crude migration and age specific migration rates were derived from the number of people moving in or out of the DSS site and the person-years lived. The population at baseline survey was 25,264 individuals in 5,853 households. The percentage of deaths was higher among adult aged 15-60 years compared to other age groups. The probability of dying among males (376/1000) aged 15-60 years was higher than females (339/1000) in the same age group. The lifetime and period fertility estimates were 5.6 and 5.1 children per woman respectively. Women aged 30-34 years are expected to have 3-4 children at the end of their childbearing age. Migration were higher at the youngest ages, lower rates at the 10-14 years age groups, a peak at the 20-24 ages, and a gradual decline up to the oldest ages. Majority of households in rural areas 51.8% were 1 in low socioeconomic status compared to 40.3% in urban areas which were in high socio-economic status. About 74% and 55.5% of the children received BCG and measles vaccination, respectively. In conclusion, Korogwe DSS has provided useful data which was utilised in planning malaria vaccine trials. Findings from the DSS will also be used in planning of future clinical trials and by the District authorities as input for health and other development planning purposes, including setting of crucial priorities."

Overall, the majority of diseases reported in the country were viral in nature followed by bacterial diseases. The trend for the occurrence shows a number of new emerging diseases as well as re-occurrence of old diseases in both animal (domestic and wild) and human populations. In humans, the major disease epidemics reported in the last five decades include cholera, influenza A H1N1, plague and rubella. In animals, the major epidemic diseases reported were Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia, Contagious Caprine Pleuropneumonia, Peste des petits ruminants and Giraffe Ear and Skin Diseases. Some epidemics have been reported in both human and animal populations including Rift Valley fever and anthrax.  The emergence of the ‘fit-for purpose’ approaches and technologies such as the discipline of One Health, use of participatory epidemiology and disease surveillance and mobile technologies offers opportunity for optimal use of limited resources to improve early detection, diagnosis and response to disease events and consequently reduced impact of such diseases in animal and human populations."

The study was carried out in Rufiji District south eastern Tanzania from October 2001 and September 2004. Adult mosquitoes were collected indoors by CDC light traps. PCR was employed to identify the species within the Anopheles gambiae complex. ELISA was used to determine the sporozoite rate. Over a three year sampling period a total of 64,875 female mosquitoes were caught using light-traps, and of these 28% were Anopheles gambiae complex, 25% An. funestus Giles, 1% An. pharoensis Theobald, 46% Culex species and the rest were Mansonia uniformis Theobald. Mosquito abundance and species composition varied seasonally, spatially and between years. Using PCR, three members of the Anopheles gambiae complex namely An. gambiae s.s. Giles (69%), An. arabiensis Paton (23%) and An. merus Dönitz (7%) were confirmed to occur in the study area. Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite antigen (CSA) rates were 3.5% for An. gambiae complex and 2.3% for An. funestus. The mean EIR ranged from 28-275 infective bites/person/year. Transmission indices varied over short distances, seasonally and between years. In conclusion, malaria transmission indices in the study area are one of the highest in Tanzania; and there is high variability of entomological parameters over a small geographical area."

However, incorporating MC in HIV/AIDS prevention programme will increase its demand in Tanzania where traditional male circumcision is common and the health care system is weak. The objective of this study was to determine the challenges and opportunities of involving traditional practitioners in scaling up safe MC in the context of HIV prevention in Tanzania. The study was conducted in Monduli, Bahi and Mkuranga districts of Tanzania. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed. Household survey involved community members from the selected villages. In-depth interviews involved traditional practitioners and key informants at national, district and facility levels. A total of 601 householders were interviewed. Most (71.4%) household respondents preferred traditional MC as it was part of their culture and tradition. A similar response was obtained from other respondents. It was mostly preferred because it was used as an initiation school, turning of boys to warriors and sense of social cohesion. Only 228 (37.9%) of the respondents were aware of the adverse events associated with MC. The most frequently mentioned adverse effects were severe bleeding (65.0%), delayed wound healing (17.5%) and wound sepsis (8.4%). The risk of acquiring HIV through male circumcision practice was poorly known among community members except medical respondents. Single unsterilized local surgical equipment was used to circumcise several initiates. It was observed that interference with traditional values associated with circumcision to be the main hindrance of linkage between traditional and conventional practitioners. On the other hand it was reported that there was no policy or guidelines on Traditional MC (TMC). Most of respondents supported the efforts to establish and promote formal linkages between traditional and conventional practitioners. In conclusion, under the current HIV pandemic and TMC being prevalent in Tanzania, it is high time for the government to establish a linkage between traditional and conventional practitioners for safe practices in order to minimize HIV transmission."

In this study, the performance of an ultrasensitive p24 antigen assay on dried blood spots was evaluated under field conditions in rural Tanzania. Specimens were stored and shipped at tropical room temperature, and analysed within six weeks.

Compared with quinine as a baseline, artesunate showed an incremental cost per DALY averted and an incremental cost per death averted of US$ 3.8 and US$ 123, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                         CONCLUSION: Artesunate is a highly cost-effective and affordable alternative to quinine for treating children with severe malaria. The budgetary implications of adopting artesunate for routine use in hospital-based care are negligible."

This was achieved by examining the distribution of the Simulium damnosum complex vector cytospecies outside the focus to look for potential sources of re-invasion. Besides cytotaxonomic identifications of the aquatic stages, we applied morphotaxonomic and molecular techniques to identify S. thyolense and confirm it as the anthropophilic species in both the Tukuyu and the neighbouring Ruvuma foci. We detected significant differences in chromosome inversion frequencies between the Tukuyu populations and those breeding to the southwest in the adjacent Songwe river basin and in northern Malawi (where there is no man-biting and no onchocerciasis), suggesting that there is not normally a great deal of migration in either direction. By contrast, populations of S. thyolense from the Tukuyu and Ruvuma foci (150km southeast of Tukuyu) were much more similar in terms of their chromosomal polymorphisms, indicating a higher possibility of re-invasion, although migration is still restricted to some extent, as indicated by some differences in chromosome polymorphisms between the two foci. Future migratory events which might be associated with vector control operations can be monitored by vector cytospecies identification, the frequency of polymorphic inversions which characterise the different vector populations, and the identification of accompanying non-vector cytospecies (e.g. S. plumbeum and cytotype Kasyabone occur exclusively in the two foci, and hence their re-appearance in Tukuyu could have only one outside source). The morphology of the scutal pattern of neonate males may act as a quick test for vector species identification where chromosome squashes are unavailable."

However, in many countries including Tanzania, much emphasis has been directed towards human resources for health with the total exclusion of human resources for health research. The objective of this study was to systematically investigate the capacity building process for the Tanzanian National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) over a 30-year period and identify the challenges and opportunities in creating a critical mass of multi-disciplinary research scientists that is required for achieving the intended health benefits. A desk review of personnel database was conducted for information covering 1980-2009 on academic qualifications, training, research experience and research output. The current staff curriculum vitae (CV) were reviewed to gather information on researchers' employment record, training, training support, area of expertise and scientific output. Interviews were conducted with a cross section of researchers on capacity development aspects using a self-administered questionnaire. In-depth interviews were also conducted with the current and former NIMR Management to seek information on capacity development challenges. A review was also done on staff personal files, annual reports, strategic plans and other occasional documents. A total of 163 CV were assessed; of these, 76.7% (125) were for Research Scientists (RS), 20.9% (34) Laboratory Technologists (LT) and 2.4% (4) for System Analysts. The Institute had 13 research scientists upon its establishment. Since 1980, NIMR has recruited a total of 185 Research Scientists. By 2009, NIMR had a total scientific workforce of 170 staff (RS= 82.4%; LT= 17.6%). Of the 140 RSs, 37 (26.4%), were first degree; 77 (55.5%) second degree while 26 (18.6%) were PhD degree holders. Of the total of 78 researchers interviewed, 55 (70.5%) indicated to have accessed postgraduate training through their personal efforts and 23 through institutional arrangement. Sixty (77%) respondents were satisfied with their tenure at NIMR. Seventy (89%) indicated that they had not at any point considered leaving NIMR. Most (79%) research scientists were recruited while holding a first degree, a few (17%) with second degree while only one (0.7%) holding a PhD degree. NIMR has experienced a research scientist attrition rate of 17.5%. Staff retention factors included availability of training opportunities; passion for conducting research; and good career prospects. Despite having a training programme, the institute has never at any moment been able to hold its own training resources. Being a public research institution, NIMR receives its core funding from the government of the United Republic of Tanzania. The bulk of the funding appears to be spent on personnel emoluments that take up to 85% (mean = 66%) of the allocated budget. In conclusion, the current NIMR's research capacity building is dependent mainly on foreign funding and personal initiatives. There is an urgent need to increase local funding for capacity building and conduct of research. A programme should be put in place to ensure sustainability of the capacity building process."

METHODS: We randomly assigned children with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion to receive boluses of 20 to 40 ml of 5% albumin solution (albumin-bolus group) or 0.9% saline solution (saline-bolus group) per kilogram of body weight or no bolus (control group) at the time of admission to a hospital in Uganda, Kenya, or Tanzania (stratum A); children with severe hypotension were randomly assigned to one of the bolus groups only (stratum B). All children received appropriate antimicrobial treatment, intravenous maintenance fluids, and supportive care, according to guidelines. Children with malnutrition or gastroenteritis were excluded. The primary end point was 48-hour mortality; secondary end points included pulmonary edema, increased intracranial pressure, and mortality or neurologic sequelae at 4 weeks.                                                                                                                                                  RESULTS: The data and safety monitoring committee recommended halting recruitment after 3141 of the projected 3600 children in stratum A were enrolled. Malaria status (57% overall) and clinical severity were similar across groups. The 48-hour mortality was 10.6% (111 of 1050 children), 10.5% (110 of 1047 children), and 7.3% (76 of 1044 children) in the albumin-bolus, saline-bolus, and control groups, respectively (relative risk for saline bolus vs. control, 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.90; P=0.01; relative risk for albumin bolus vs. saline bolus, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.29; P=0.96; and relative risk for any bolus vs. control, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.86; P=0.003). The 4-week mortality was 12.2%, 12.0%, and 8.7% in the three groups, respectively (P=0.004 for the comparison of bolus with control). Neurologic sequelae occurred in 2.2%, 1.9%, and 2.0% of the children in the respective groups (P=0.92), and pulmonary edema or increased intracranial pressure occurred in 2.6%, 2.2%, and 1.7% (P=0.17), respectively. In stratum B, 69% of the children (9 of 13) in the albumin-bolus group and 56% (9 of 16) in the saline-bolus group died (P=0.45).

Specifically, the paper examines the process, actors and contextual factors shaping decentralized health care priority setting processes. The analysis and conclusion are based on a review of documents, key informant interviews, focus group discussion, and notes from non-participant observation. The findings of the study indicate that local institutional contexts and power asymmetries among actors have a greater influence on the prioritization process at the local level than expected and intended. The paper underlines the essentially political character of the decentralization process and reiterates the need for policy analysts to pay attention to processes, institutional contexts, and the role of policy actors in shaping the implementation of the decentralization process at the district level."

This paper summarises the review of published papers on the magnitude of Non Communicable Diseases in the country. Current opportunities for management and control of NCDs are also explored. In this review diseases such as diabetes and hypertension have been shown to have increased over the years. Prevalence of risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia and smoking has been shown to be high with clear gender and urban rural differences. Generally there is paucity of national representative data on the burden of risk factors and prevalence of non-communicable diseases. The main risk factors for NCDs namely smoking, alcohol intake, unhealthy diet and low physical activity are prevalent in both rural and urban communities. The socio-demographic and economic transition has a big role in the current rise of non-communicable diseases in Tanzania. There are initiatives to control the burden of non-communicable diseases in the country. However there is need to focus more on primary prevention at population level targeting interventions to reduce exposure to tobacco, reduce alcohol intake, reduce salt intake, promote healthy diets and physical activity. For the prevention and control of NCDs, there needs to be a continuum from primary to tertiary prevention and a scope of interventions from the community level up to the national level. Community-based interventions are needed targeting the risk factors for primary prevention. In addition, secondary prevention measures are needed targeting those at high risk to ensure that they are identified early through a high risk targeted screening for early identification and appropriate care. Effective policies are needed to support such interventions."

A number of potential human health effects have been associated either directly or indirectly with global climate change. Vulnerability to the risks associated with CC may exacerbate ongoing socio-economic challenges. The objective of this review was to analyse the potential risk and vulnerability in the context of climate-sensitive human diseases and health system in Tanzania. Climate sensitive vector- and water-borne diseases and other health related problems and the policies on climate adaptation in Tanzania during the past 50 years are reviewed. The review has shown that a number of climate-associated infectious disease epidemics have been reported in various areas of the country; mostly being associated with increase in precipitation and temperature. Although, there is no single policy document that specifically addresses issues of CC in the country, the National Environmental Management Act of 1997 recognizes the importance of CC and calls for the government to put up measures to address the phenomenon. A number of strategies and action plans related to CC are also in place. These include the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, the National Action Programme, and the National Bio-safety Framework. The government has put in place a National Climate Change Steering Committee and the National Climate Change Technical Committee to oversee and guide the implementation of CC activities in the country. Recognizing the adverse impacts of natural disasters and calamities, the government established a Disaster Management Division under the Prime Minister’s Office. Epidemic Preparedness and Response Unit of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is responsible for emergency preparedness, mostly disease outbreaks. However, specific climate changes associated with human health issues are poorly addressed in the MoHSW strategies and the national health research priorities. In conclusion, CC threatens to slow, halt or reverses the progress the country has made or is making to achieve its national and millennium development goals. It is therefore important that Tanzania prepares itself to appropriately address CC impact on human health. It is equally important that policy makers and other stakeholders are engaged in a process to update and adapt priorities, mobilize resources and build interdisciplinary research and implementation capacity on climate change and its mitigation."

Overall, 60% of all schoolchildren had at least an infection of either P. falciparum, W. bancrofti, S. haematobium or hookworm. The highest prevalence of P. falciparum (75.3%), W. bancrofti (62.9%) and hookworm (24.7%) infections was observed among children in flooding rice irrigation ecosystem. P. falciparum+S. haematobium (10.9%) and P. falciparum+W. bancrofti (11.1%) were the most prevalent types of coinfection in the area. The highest prevalence of double parasitic infections was observed among children in the flooding rice irrigation ecosystems. The risk for acquiring coinfections of P. falciparum+W. bancrofti was significantly higher among children in the flooding rice irrigation ecosystem. Forty-five (7.8%) children were coinfected with three types of parasitic infections. The risk of acquiring triple infection among children from flooding rice irrigation was higher for P. falciparum+S. haematobium+W. bancrofti (p<0.001). Seven schoolchildren (1.2%) were found infected with four parasites and all were from the flooding rice irrigation ecosystem. Significantly high P. falciparum geometric parasite density was observed among children coinfected with either hookworms or W. bancrofti (p<0.001). On average, 17.8% (103/578) of the children had enlarged spleens. Over 3- and 4-folds increase in the risk of having an enlarged spleen were observed among children coinfected with P. falciparum+S. haematobium and P. falciparum+W. bancrofti, respectively. The overall prevalence of anaemia (<11.5g/dl) was 61.9% (358/578).

Results of this study suggest that integrated control of malaria and helminthes should be designed based on the local agro-ecosystems."

Recent reports indicate a pronounced decline in infection and disease rates which are commonly ascribed to large-scale bed net programmes and improved case management. However, the decline has also occurred in areas with limited or no intervention. The present study assessed temporal changes in Anopheline populations in two highly malaria-endemic communities of NE Tanzania during the period 1998-2009. Between 1998 and 2001 (1st period) and between 2003 and 2009 (2nd period), mosquitoes were collected weekly in 50 households using CDC light traps. Data on rainfall were obtained from the nearby climate station and were used to analyze the association between monthly rainfall and malaria mosquito populations. The average number of Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus per trap decreased by 76.8% and 55.3%, respectively over the 1st period, and by 99.7% and 99.8% over the 2nd period. During the last year of sampling (2009), the use of 2368 traps produced a total of only 14 Anopheline mosquitoes. With the exception of the decline in An. gambiae during the 1st period, the results did not reveal any statistical association between mean trend in monthly rainfall and declining malaria vector populations. A longitudinal decline in the density of malaria mosquito vectors was seen during both study periods despite the absence of organized vector control. Part of the decline could be associated with changes in the pattern of monthly rainfall, but other factors may also contribute to the dramatic downward trend. A similar decline in malaria vector densities could contribute to the decrease in levels of malaria infection reported from many parts of SSA."

Results Lack of a specific and overarching NCD policy has slowed and fragmented the implementation of existing strategies to prevent and control NCDs and their determinants. The health system is not prepared to deal with the rising NCD burden although there are random initiatives to improve this situation. How the community is responding to these emerging conditions is still unknown, and the current health-seeking behavior and perceptions on the risk factors may not favor control of NCDs and their risk factors. Conclusion and recommendation There is limited information on the burden and determinants of NCDs to inform the design of an integrative and multisectorial policy. Evidence on effective interventions for NCD services in primary care levels and on community perceptions on NCDs and their care seeking is virtually absent. Research and public health interventions must be anchored in the policy, health system, and community platforms for a holistic response."

Several frameworks exist for monitoring and evaluating funding results and modalities. Based on its long history of support, we report on the impact of individual and institutional capacity strengthening programmes conducted by the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and on the factors that influenced the outcome of its Research Capacity Strengthening (RCS) activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Methodology and Principal Findings: A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods (questionnaires and in-depth interviews) was applied to a selected group of 128 individual and 20 institutional capacity development grant recipients that completed their training/projects between 2000 and 2008. A semi-structured interview was also conducted on site with scientists from four institutions. Most of the grantees, both individual and institutional, reported beneficial results from the grant. However, glaring inequities stemming from gender imbalances and a language bias towards English were identified. The study showed that skills improvement through training contributed to better formulation of research proposals, but not necessarily to improved project implementation or communication of results. Appreciation of the institutional grants' impact varied among recipient countries. The least developed countries saw the programmes as essential for supporting basic infrastructure and activities. Advanced developing countries perceived the research grants as complementary to available resources, and particularly suitable for junior researchers who were not yet able to compete for major international grants.                                                            Conclusion: The study highlights the need for a more equitable process to improve the effectiveness of health research capacity strengthening activities. Support should be tailored to the existing research capacity in disease endemic countries and should focus on strengthening national health research systems, particularly in the least developing countries. The engagement of stakeholders at country level would facilitate the design of more specific and comprehensive strategies based on local needs."

According to health statistics, malaria accounts for about 30% and 15% of hospital admissions and deaths, respectively. The risk of P. falciparum infection varies across the country. This study describes the spatial variation and socio-economic determinants of P. falciparum infection in northeastern Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                                                             METHODS: The study was conducted in 14 villages located in highland, lowland and urban areas of Korogwe district. Four cross-sectional malaria surveys involving individuals aged 0-19 years were conducted during short (Nov-Dec) and long (May-Jun) rainy seasons from November 2005 to June 2007. Household socio-economic status (SES) data were collected between Jan-April 2006 and household's geographical positions were collected using hand-held geographical positioning system (GPS) unit. The effects of risk factors were determined using generalized estimating equation and spatial risk of P. falciparum infection was modelled using a kernel (non-parametric) method.                                                                                             RESULTS: There was a significant spatial variation of P. falciparum infection, and urban areas were at lower risk. Adjusting for covariates, high risk of P. falciparum infection was identified in rural areas of lowland and highland. Bed net coverage levels were independently associated with reduced risk of P. falciparum by 19.1% (95%CI: 8.9-28.2, p < 0.001) and by 39.3% (95%CI: 28.9-48.2, p < 0.001) in households with low and high coverage, respectively, compared to those without bed nets. Households with moderate and lower SES had risk of infection higher than 60% compared to those with higher SES; while inhabitants of houses built of mud walls were at 15.5% (95%CI: 0.1 - 33.3, p < 0.048) higher risk compared to those living in houses built by bricks. Individuals in houses with thatched roof had an excess risk of 17.3% (95%CI: 4.1 - 32.2, p < 0.009) compared to those living in houses roofed with iron sheet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  CONCLUSIONS: There was high spatial variation of risk of P. falciparum infection and urban area was at the lowest risk. High bed net coverage, better SES and good housing were among the important risk factors associated with low risk of P. falciparum infection."

Parasites & Vectors 4:234",Neglected Tropical Diseases and the Millennium Development Goals- Why the other diseases matter- rhetoric vs. reality,Neglected Tropical Diseases ,Parasites & Vectors ,2011,4,,234,,2,,,,,,,,,"Since 2004 there has been an increased recognition of the importance of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) as impediments to development. These diseases are caused by a variety of infectious agents - viruses, bacteria and parasites - which cause a diversity of clinical conditions throughout the tropics. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has defined seventeen of these conditions as core NTDs. The objectives for the control, elimination or eradication of these conditions have been defined in World Health Assembly resolutions whilst the strategies for the control or elimination of individual diseases have been defined in various WHO documents. Since 2005 there has been a drive for the expanded control of these diseases through an integrated approach of mass drug administration referred to as Preventive Chemotherapy via community-based distribution systems and through schools. This has been made possible by donations from major pharmaceutical companies of quality and efficacious drugs which have a proven track record of safety. As a result of the increased commitment of endemic countries, bilateral donors and non-governmental development organisations, there has been a considerable expansion of mass drug administration. In particular, programmes targeting lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis, trachoma and soil transmitted helminth infections have expanded to treat 887. 8 million people in 2009. There has been significant progress towards guinea worm eradication, and the control of leprosy and human African trypanosomiasis. This paper responds to what the authors believe are inappropriate criticisms of these programmes and counters accusations of the motives of partners made in recently published papers. We provide a detailed response and update the information on the numbers of global treatments undertaken for NTDs and list the success stories to date.The paper acknowledges that in undertaking any health programme in environments such as post-conflict countries, there are always challenges. It is also recognised that NTD control must always be undertaken within the health system context. However, it is important to emphasise that the availability of donated drugs, the multiple impact of those drugs, the willingness of countries to undertake their distribution, thereby committing their own resources to the programmes, and the proven beneficial results outweigh the problems which are faced in environments where communities are often beyond the reach of health services. Given the availability of these interventions, their cost effectiveness and the broader development impact we believe it would be unethical not to continue programmes of such long term benefit to the ""bottom billion""."

Severe anaemia and cerebral malaria are the two main causes of death due to malaria in Tanga, Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                      Methods: This was a prospective observational hospital-based study conducted from October 2004 to September 2005. Consent was sought from study participants or guardians in the wards. Finger prick blood was collected from each individual for thick and thin smears, blood sugar levels and haemoglobin estimations by Haemocue machine after admission Results: A total of 494 patients were clinically diagnosed and admitted as cases of severe malaria. Majority of them (55.3%) were children below the age of 5 years. Only 285 out of the total 494 (57.7%) patients had positive blood smears for malaria parasites. Adults aged 20 years and above had the highest rate of cases with fever and blood smear negative for malaria parasites. Commonest clinical manifestations of severe malaria were cerebral malaria (47.3%) and severe anaemia (14.6%), particularly in the under-fives. Case fatality was 3.2% and majority of the deaths occurred in the under-fives and adults aged 20 years and above with negative blood smears.                                                                                                                Conclusion: Proper laboratory diagnosis is crucial for case management and reliable data collection. The non-specific nature of malaria symptomatologies limits the use of clinical diagnosis and the IMCI strategy. Strengthening of laboratory investigations to guide case management is recommended."

Various sub-Saharan African countries are at different stages of rolling out MC programmes. Despite initial fears, studies conducted among traditionally non-circumcising communities in Africa have shown that MC is widely accepted as a biomedical intervention. However, little is known on how traditionally circumcising communities where MC carries considerable social meaning and significance would respond to such programmes. This study was conducted among a traditionally circumcising community in Tarime district in Tanzania as part of a national situation analysis prior to initiating a national MC programme. It employed key informant interviews and focus group discussions for data collection. Results show that the Kurya ethnic group practice MC as a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood. Each clan organises its own circumcision ceremony, which takes place every even numbered years. Clan leaders and traditional circumcisers are central to its organisation. Among the Kurya, there is high regard for traditional MC as it is perceived as upholding cultural practice and identity. It also embodies notions of bravery since anaesthetics are not used. On the other hand, medical MC is not viewed as prestigious since anaesthetics are used to suppress pain. Social pressure for traditional MC is applied through ridiculing of those uncircumcised or circumcised at health facilities. In general, there are positive attitudes towards MC as it is perceived as enhancing personal hygiene and having a protective effect against sexually transmitted infections. For the success of nation-wide MC programmes, there is need to develop programmes that incorporate both clinical and sociocultural interests."

Results: PD sufferers expressed frustration with the physical, psychological, social and economic consequences of the illness. Feelings of a diminished quality of life characterized by dependency, stigma and social isolation were common. Additionally, a handful of male sufferers related their sexual incompetence to the illness. Carers complained of lost income opportunities and social isolation resulting from caring for sufferers. Misconceptions about the cause, symptoms and appropriated PD treatment were widespread. Only 2 PD sufferers had commenced western type treatment through outsourcing drugs from other parts of the country and outside of Tanzania.

Data on severely ill febrile children aged 2 months to 14 years from three prospective studies conducted at Muheza District Hospital from 2006 to 2010 was pooled and analysed. On admission, each enrolled child had a thin and thick blood film and at least one rapid diagnostic test for falciparum malaria, as well as a blood culture. The annual incidence of bacteraemia and severe malaria among children coming from Muheza was calculated and their temporal trend was assessed. Overall, 1, 898 severe falciparum malaria and 684 bacteraemia cases were included. Of these, 1, 356 (71%) and 482 (71%), respectively, were from the referral population of Muheza. The incidence of falciparum malaria and all-cause bacteraemia in Muheza decreased five-fold and three-fold, respectively, from the first to the fourth year of surveillance (p < 0.0001). During this period, the median ages of children from Muheza admitted with severe malaria increased from 1.7 to 2.5 years (p < 0.0001). The reduction in all-cause bacteraemia was mainly driven by the 11-fold decline in the incidence of non-typhoidal salmonellosis. The annual incidences of Haemophilus influenzae and pneumococcal invasive bacterial infections decreased as well but were much fewer in number. These results add to the growing evidence of the decline in malaria associated with a decrease in non-typhoidal salmonellosis and possibly other bacteraemias. Malarial prevention and control strategies may provide a greater benefit than the mere reduction of malaria alone."

However, there is limited evidence of the safety of this policy in routine outpatient settings in Africa.                                                               Methods: Children 3-59 months of age with a non-severe febrile illness and no obvious cause were enrolled over a period of one year in a malaria endemic area of Tanzania. Treatment was determined by the results of a clinical examination and RDT result, and blood culture and serum lactate were also collected. RDT-negative children were followed up over 14 days.  Results: Over the course of one year, 965 children were enrolled; 158 (16.4%) were RDT-positive and treated with artemether-lumefantrine and 807 (83.4%) were RDT-negative and treated with non-anti-malarial medicines. Compared with RDT-positives, RDT-negative children were on average younger with a lower axillary temperature and more likely to have a history of cough or difficulty in breathing. Six (0.6%) children became RDT-positive after enrolment, all of whom were PCR-negative for Plasmodium falciparumDNA at enrolment. In addition, 12 (1.2%) children were admitted to hospital, one with possible malaria, none of whom died. A bacterial pathogen was identified in 9/965 (0.9%) children, eight of whom were RDT-negative and one was RDT-positive, but slide-negative. Excluding three children with Salmonella typhi, all of the children with bacteraemia were ?12 months of age. Compared to double-read research slide results RDTs had a sensitivity of 97.8% (95%CI 96.9-98.7) and specificity of 96.3% (95%CI 96.3-98.4).                                                                                                                 Conclusions: Use of RDTs to direct the use of anti-malarial drugs in young children did not result in any missed diagnoses of malaria although new infections soon after a consultation with a negative RDT result may undermine confidence in results. Invasive bacterial disease is uncommon in children with non-severe illness and most cases occurred in infants with a current fever."

Conclusions: Paracheck had poor specificity in diagnosing malaria in severely ill children; this was likely to be due to HRP2 persistence following recent parasite clearance. The combination of positive Paracheck and negative blood slide results identified a group of children at high risk of non-typhi Salmonella infection. While Paracheck was highly sensitive, some high-density infections were missed.

We evaluated the use of a point-of-care (POC) diagnostic device for blood lactate measurement to assess the severity of illness in children admitted to a district hospital in Tanzania. Children between the ages of 2 months and 13 years with a history of fever were enrolled in the study during a period of 1 year. A full clinical history and examination were undertaken, and blood was collected for culture, microscopy, complete blood cell count, and POC measurement of blood lactate and glucose. The study included 3248 children, of whom 164 (5.0%) died; 45 (27.4%) of these had raised levels of blood lactate (>5 mmol/L) but no deep breathing. Compared with mortality in children with lactate levels of ? 3 mmol/L, the unadjusted odds of dying were 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI].8-3.0), 3.4 (95% CI, 1.5-7.5), and 8.9 (95% CI, 4.7-16.8) in children with blood lactate levels of 3.1-5.0, 5.1-8.0, or >8.0 mmol/L, respectively. The prevalence of raised lactate levels (>5 mmol/L) was greater in children with malaria than in children with nonmalarial febrile illness (P < .001) although the associated mortality was greater in slide-negative children. POC lactate measurement can contribute to the assessment of children admitted to hospital with febrile illness and can also create an opportunity for more hospitals in resource-poor settings to participate in clinical trials of interventions to reduce mortality associated with hyperlactatemia."

However, the policy environment (whether to formulate new specific policy on MC or adapts the existing ones); and the role of various stakeholders in the MC scale up process in Tanzania was unclear. We conducted this study as part of a situation analysis to understand the attitudes of policy makers and other key community and health authority decision makers towards MC, policy and regulatory environment, and the readiness of a health system to accommodate scaling up of MC services.                                             METHODS: We conducted 36 key informants' interviews with a broad range of informants including civil servants, religious leaders, cultural and traditional gatekeepers and other potential informants. Study informants were selected at the national level, regional, district and community levels to represent both traditionally circumcising and non-circumcising communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    RESULTS: Study informants had positive attitudes and strong beliefs towards MC. Key informants in traditionally non-circumcising districts were willing to take their sons for medically performed MC. Religious leaders and traditional gatekeepers supported MC as it has been enshrined in their holy scripts and traditional customs respectively. Civil servants highlighted the need for existence of enabling policy and regulatory environment in the form of laws, regulations and guidelines that will ensure voluntary accessibility, acceptability, quality and safety for those in need of MC services. Majority of informants urged the government to make improvements in the health system at all levels to ensure availability of adequate trained personnel, infrastructure, equipment, and supplies for MC scale up, and insisted on the involvement of different MC stakeholders as key components in effective roll out of medically performed MC programme in the country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the situation analysis in Tanzania have shown that despite the absence of a specific policy on MC, basic elements of enabling policy environment at national, regional, district and community levels are in place for the implementation of MC scale up programme."

Mosquitoes were sampled using the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) light traps. A total of 110,357 adult female mosquitoes were collected. Anopheles gambiae s.1. accounted 25% of the total female mosquito collected. Relatively fewer An. funestus were collected. Other mosquito species collected were An. pharoensis, An. coustani, An. maculipalpis, An. marshallii, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx unnivittatus, Mansonia uniformis and Ma. africana. An analysis by Polymerase Chain Reaction revealed that An. arabiensis was the only member of the An. gambiae complex in the collected samples. The number of mosquito collected correlated with the increasing mean rainfall. Blood meal analysis showed a higher human enzymatic reaction among An. gambiae s.1. (63.5%) followed by An. funestus (42.9%). Bovine enzymatic reaction was higher among An. coustani (73.7%) followed by the An. pharoensis (66.7%). The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to detect Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoites proteins in 10,000 female Anopheles mosquitoes. Only two An. arabiensis were found to be infected. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was estimated at 0.51 infectious bites per person per year. This EIR was considered to be relatively low, indicating that malaria transmission in this area is low. Variability in mosquito blood meal shows availability of variety of preferred blood meal choices and impact of other factors inhibiting mosquito-human host contact. The study has provided information considered useful in the mapping of the vector distribution and population structure in the country. Such information is considered to be among the essential tools for planning malaria control interventions."

The objective of this study was to estimate the malaria burden based on serological data and prevalence of malaria, and compare it with existing self-treatment practices in Magugu in Babati District of northern Tanzania. Prospectively, 470 individuals were selected for the study. Both microscopy and Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) were used for malaria diagnosis. Seroprevalence of antibodies to merozoite surface proteins (MSP-119) and apical membrane antigen (AMA-1) was performed and the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) was estimated. To complement this information, retrospective data on treatment history, prescriptions by physicians and use of bed nets were collected. Malaria prevalence in the area was 6.8% (32/470). Of 130 individuals treated with artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), 22.3 % (29/130) were slide confirmed while 75.3% (98/130) of them were blood smear negative. Three of the slides confirmed individuals were not treated with ACT. Fever was reported in 38.2% of individuals, of whom 48.8 % (88/180) were given ACT. Forty-two (32.3%) of those who received ACT had no history of fever. About half (51.1%) of those treated with ACT were children <10 years old. Immunoglobulin against MSP-119 was positive in 16.9% (74/437) while against AMA-1 was positive in 29.8 % (130/436). Transmission intensity was estimated at <0.2 infectious bites per person per year. The RDT was highly specific (96.3%) but with low sensitivity (15.6%).  Magugu is a low endemic area. There is substantial over diagnosis, over treatment and self treatment in the community.   The burden of malaria based on medical records is over estimated   as was mostly presumptive. The low sensitivity of RDT reflects the low number of immune individuals as well as the low parasite density."

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Four trial sites in the Philippines, Mauritania, Tanzania and Brazil enrolled 856 patients using a common protocol, who were randomised to receive praziquantel 40 mg/kg (n? =? 428) or 60 mg/kg (n? =? 428). While the sites differed for transmission and infection intensities (highest in Tanzania and lowest in Mauritania), no bias or heterogeneity across sites was detected for the main efficacy outcomes. The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of cure rates on Day 21 in the intent-to-treat population for the pooled data using a logistic model to calculate Odd Ratios allowing for baseline characteristics and study site. Both doses were highly effective: the Day 21 cure rates were 91.7% (86.6%-98% at individual sites) with 40 mg/kg and 92.8% (88%-97%) with 60 mg/kg. Secondary parameters were eggs reduction rates (ERR), change in intensity of infection and reinfection rates at 6 and 12 months. On Day 21 the pooled estimate of the ERR was 91% in both arms. The Hazard Ratio for reinfections was only significant in Brazil, and in favour of 60 mg/kg on the pooled estimate (40 mg/kg: 34.3%, 60 mg/kg: 23.9%, HR ?=? 0.78, 95% CI? =?[0.63;0.96]). Analysis of safety could not distinguish between disease- and drug-related events. 666 patients (78%) reported 1327 adverse events (AE) 4 h post-dosing. The risk of having at least one AE was higher in the 60 than in the 40 mg/kg group (83% vs. 73%, p<0.001). At 24 h post-dosing, 456 patients (54%) had 918 AEs with no difference between arms. The most frequent AE was abdominal pain at both 4 h and 24 h (40% and 24%).     CONCLUSION:A higher dose of 60 mg/kg of praziquantel offers no significant efficacy advantage over standard 40 mg/kg for treating intestinal schistosomiasis caused by either S. mansoni or S. japonicum. The results of this study support WHO recommendation and should be used to inform policy decisions in the countries."

A previous study of the malaria vaccine RTS,S (which targets the circumsporozoite protein), given with an adjuvant system (AS02A), showed a 30% rate of protection against clinical malaria in children 1 to 4 years of age. We evaluated the efficacy of RTS,S given with a more immunogenic adjuvant system (AS01E) in children 5 to 17 months of age, a target population for vaccine licensure.                                                                                                                         METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial of RTS,S/AS01E vaccine as compared with rabies vaccine in children in Kilifi, Kenya, and Korogwe, Tanzania. The primary end point was fever with a falciparum parasitemia density of more than 2500 parasites per microliter, and the mean duration of follow-up was 7.9 months (range, 4.5 to 10.5).                            RESULTS: A total of 894 children were randomly assigned to receive the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine or the control (rabies) vaccine. Among the 809 children who completed the study procedures according to the protocol, the cumulative number in whom clinical malaria developed was 32 of 402 assigned to receive RTS,S/AS01E and 66 of 407 assigned to receive the rabies vaccine; the adjusted efficacy rate for RTS,S/AS01E was 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28 to 69; P<0.001) on the basis of Cox regression. Overall, there were 38 episodes of clinical malaria among recipients of RTS,S/AS01E, as compared with 86 episodes among recipients of the rabies vaccine, with an adjusted rate of efficacy against all malarial episodes of 56% (95% CI, 31 to 72; P<0.001). All 894 children were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, which showed an unadjusted efficacy rate of 49% (95% CI, 26 to 65; P<0.001). There were fewer serious adverse events among recipients of RTS,S/AS01E, and this reduction was not only due to a difference in the number of admissions directly attributable to malaria.             CONCLUSIONS:RTS,S/AS01E shows promise as a candidate malaria vaccine. (ClinicalTrials.gov number"

Among HIV- patients, multi-micronutrient supplementation increased weight gain by 590 g (95% CI = -40, 1210; P = 0.07) and handgrip strength by 1.6 kg (95% CI = 0.78, 2.47; P < 0.001), whereas among HIV+ patients, it reduced weight gain by 1440 g (95% CI = 290, 2590; P = 0.002) and had no effect on handgrip strength (0.07 kg; 95% CI = -1.30, 1.46; P = 0.91). The reduced weight gain among HIV+ patients receiving multi-micronutrient supplementation seemed to be explained by a higher proportion of patients reporting fever. At 5 mo, the effects on weight were sustained, whereas there was no effect on handgrip strength. In conclusion, multi-micronutrient supplementation given as a biscuit is beneficial among HIV- PTB patients and may be recommended to TB programs. More research is needed to develop an effective supplement for HIV+ PTB patients."

We conducted a cross-sectional study among PTB+ patients and age- and sex-matched neighborhood controls. HIV status, anthropometric measurements and handgrip strength were determined. Deficits in weight, AFA, AMA and handgrip strength associated with PTB+ and HIV were estimated using multiple regression analysis. We recruited 355 pairs of PTB+ patients and controls. PTB+ was associated with deficits of 10.0kg (95% CI 7.3; 12.7) in weight and 6.8kg (95% CI 5.2; 8.3) in handgrip strength among females and 9.1kg (95% CI 7.3; 10.9) in weight and 6.8kg (95% CI 5.2; 8.4) in handgrip strength among males. In both sexes, PTB+ was associated with deficits in AFA and AMA. Among females, HIV was associated with deficits in AMA and handgrip strength, but the deficit in handgrip strength was larger among PTB+ patients (3.2kg 95% CI 1.3; 5.2) than controls (-1.6kg 95% CI -4.8; 1.5) (interaction, P=0.009). These findings suggest that deficits in weight and handgrip strength among patients starting TB treatment are severe. Thus, nutritional support may be necessary to ensure reversal of the deficits, and may improve treatment outcomes."

A new, rapid diagnostic method, (Cepheid) Xpert MTB/RIF Assay, is an automated sample preparation and real-time PCR instrument, which was shown to have good potential as an alternative to current reference standard sputum microscopy and culture.     Methods: We performed a clinical validation study on diagnostic accuracy of the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay in a TB and HIV endemic setting. Sputum samples from 292 consecutively enrolled adults from Mbeya, Tanzania, with suspected TB were subject to analysis by the Xpert MTB/RIF Assay. The diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF Assay was compared to standard sputum smear microscopy and culture. Confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a positive culture was used as a reference standard for TB diagnosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Results: Xpert MTB/RIF Assay achieved 88.4% (95%CI?=?78.4% to 94.9%) sensitivity among patients with a positive culture and 99% (95%CI?=?94.7% to 100.0%) specificity in patients who had no TB. HIV status did not affect test performance in 172 HIV-infected patients (58.9% of all participants). Seven additional cases (9.1% of 77) were detected by Xpert MTB/RIF Assay among the group of patients with clinical TB who were culture negative. Within 45 sputum samples which grew non-tuberculous mycobacteria the assay's specificity was 97.8% (95%CI?=?88.2% to 99.9%).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Conclusions: The Xpert MTB/RIF Assay is a highly sensitive, specific and rapid method for diagnosing TB which has potential to complement the current reference standard of TB diagnostics and increase its overall sensitivity. Its usefulness in detecting sputum smear and culture negative patients needs further study. Further evaluation in high burden TB and HIV areas under programmatic health care settings to ascertain applicability, cost-effectiveness, robustness and local acceptance are required."

In this article, we document the effect of scaling up a school-based intervention (MEMA kwa Vijana) from 62 to 649 schools on the coverage and quality of implementation.                                                            METHODS: Observations of 1,111 students' exercise books, 11 ASRH sessions, and 19 peer-assistant role plays were supplemented with interviews with 47 ASRH-trained teachers, to assess the coverage and quality of ASRH sessions in schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            RESULTS: Despite various modifications, the 10-fold scale-up achieved high coverage. A total of 89% (989) of exercise books contained some MEMA kwa Vijana 2 notes. Teachers were enthusiastic and interacted well with students. Students enjoyed the sessions and scripted role plays strengthened participation. Coverage of the biological topics was higher than the psycho-social sessions. The scale-up was facilitated by the structured nature of the intervention and the examined status of some topics. However, delays in the training, teacher turnover, and a lack of incentive for teaching additional activities were barriers to implementation.                                                                                                                                                              CONCLUSIONS: High coverage of participatory school-based reproductive health interventions can be maintained during scale-up. However, this is likely to be associated with significant changes in programme content and delivery. A greater emphasis should be placed on improving teachers' capacity to teach more complex-skills-related activities. Future intervention scale-up should also include an increased level of supervision and may be strengthened by underpinning from national level directives and inclusion of behavioral topics in national examinations."

","Saleability of anti-malarials in private drug shops in Muheza, Tanzania: a baseline study in an era of assumed artemisinin combination therapy (ACT)",anti-malarials,Malaria Journal,2011,10,1,238,,4,,,,,,,,,"Background: Artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) replaced sulphadoxine-pymimethamine (SP) as the official first-line anti-malarial in Tanzania in November 2006. So far, artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) is contra-indicated during pregnancy by the national malaria treatment guidelines, and pregnant women depend on SP for Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTp) during pregnancy. SP is still being dispensed by private drug stores, but it is unknown to which extent. If significant, it may undermine its official use for IPTp through induction of resistance.The main study objective was to perform a baseline study of the private market for anti-malarials in Muheza town, an area with widespread anti-malarial drug resistance, prior to the implementation of a provider training and accreditation programme that will allow accredited drug shops to sell subsidized ALu.                                                                        Methods: All drug shops selling prescription-only anti-malarials, in Muheza town, Tanga Region voluntarily participated from July to December 2009. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with owners or shopkeepers on saleability of anti-malarials, and structured questionnaires provided quantitative data on drugs sales volume.                                              Results: All surveyed drug shops illicitly sold SP and quinine (QN), and legally amodiaquine (AQ). Calculated monthly sale was 4,041 doses, in a town with a population of 15,000 people. Local brands of SP accounted for 74% of sales volume, compared to AQ (13%), QN (11%) and ACT (2%).                                                                                                                                            Conclusions: In community practice, the saleability of ACT was negligible. SP was best-selling, and use was not reserved for IPTp, as stipulated in the national anti-malarial policy. It is a major reason for concern that such drug-pressure in the community equals de facto intermittent presumptive treatment. In an area where SP drug resistance remains high, unregulated SP dispensing to people other than pregnant women runs the risk of eventually jeopardizing the effectiveness of the IPTp strategy.Further studies are recommended to find out barriers for ACT utilization and preference for self-medication and to train private drug dispensers."

",Good performance of an immunoassay based method for nevirapine measurements in human breast milk,immunoassay, Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine ,2011,49,7,1171,1175,6,,,,,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the distribution of antiretro-virals in breastfeeding HIV-positive mothers is essential, both for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission and for research on the development of drug resistance. The ARK nevirapine (NVP)-test is an immunoassay method for nevirapine measurements, developed and validated for plasma use. In this study, the ARK NVP-test was evaluated for measurement of nevirapine concentrations in breast milk. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the method currently used to determine nevirapine in breast milk. This method, however, requires complicated extraction techniques. The ARK method employs an immunoassay technology and requires a small sample volume (40 ?L) and no pre-treatment of the samples.

RESULTS: Precision and accuracy were evaluated with two concentrations of quality control materials analyzed in three replicates on four different days and was <4%, and between 96.5% and 104.6%, respectively. Clinical samples were analyzed and CVs ranged from 0.0% to 11.1%. The median nevirapine concentration in breast milk 1 week post-partum was 0.29 ?g/mL (range 0.11-0.90 ?g/mL) in women treated with a single-dose of nevirapine.

Here, we compare their concordance among 451 febrile episodes in a cohort of 2,058 children and adults followed over 6 months in a region in central Tanzania with hypoendemic malaria. Microscopy, a histidine-rich protein-based RDT, and two different real-time PCR gene probes detected Plasmodium falciparum in 20, 54, 41, and 78 episodes of fever, respectively. They had complete concordance in only 9 episodes. Real-time PCR with an 18S probe was more sensitive than with a mitochondrial probe for cytochrome b despite higher copy numbers of mitochondrial DNA. Both PCR yields were increased 4-fold by glycogen/acetate precipitation with low-speed centrifugation. Duplicate PCR increases low-density malaria detection. RDT had the highest number of unique positives, presumably from persistent antigen despite the absence of parasites, although RDT did not detect 3 parasitemias with over 1,000 parasites/?l. In a latent class analysis, real-time PCR had significantly higher sensitivity than did microscopy or RDT. Agreement between real-time PCR, RDT, and microscopy was highest in March and April, when both the P. falciparum parasite rate and parasite densities are highest.

The objective was to study the capacity of a new biomarker, the expression of the T cell maturation marker CD27 on MTB-specific CD4 T cells, to identify active tuberculosis (TB) disease in subjects from a MTB and HIV endemic region. The frequency and CD27 expression of circulating MTB-specific CD4 T cells was determined in 96 study participants after stimulation with purified protein derivative (PPD) using intracellular cytokine staining for IFNgamma (IFN?). Subjects were then stratified by their TB and HIV status. Within PPD responders, a CD27? phenotype was associated with active TB in HIV? (p?=?0.0003) and HIV+ (p?=?0.057) subjects, respectively. In addition, loss of CD27 expression preceded development of active TB in one HIV seroconverter. Interestingly, in contrast to HIV? subjects, MTB-specific CD4 T cell populations from HIV+ TB-asymptomatic subjects were often dominated by CD27? cells. These data indicate that down-regulation of CD27 on MTB-specific CD4 T cell could be used as a biomarker of active TB, potentially preceding clinical TB disease. Furthermore, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that late, chronic HIV infection is frequently associated with increased mycobacterial activity in vivo. The analysis of T cell maturation and activation markers might thus be a useful tool to monitor TB disease progression."

This study was carried out to assess food security, and coping strategies among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) attending Care and Treatment Centre (CTC) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A structured questionnaire was used to interview randomly selected adults (?18 years) who were HIV positive who have just been eligible for anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in a CTC or one who has started ART but not more than four weeks has elapsed. A total of 446 (females=67.9%; males= 32.1%) people living with HIV/AIDS attending CTC were interviewed. About three quarters (73.1%) of the respondents were 25-44 years old and most (43.9%) were married. Two thirds (66.7%) of the respondents had primary school education. Seventy percent reported to have a regular income and 63.7% with a monthly income of less than US$ 154. More than half (52.2%) of the respondents were food insecure. Food insecurity was similar in both males (54.6%) and females (51.2%). However, food insecurity was least (48.2%) among those who were single and highest (57.7%) among those cohabiting. Low level of food insecurity was associated with having completed primary education (Adjusted OR=0.27; 95%CI, 0.09–0.82) and high income (>US$154) (OR=0.10; 95%CI, 0.01–0.67). Reporting two or less meals increased the likelihood of food insecurity (OR=4.2; 95% CI1.7-9.8). Low frequency of meals was significantly more prevalent (18.6%) among those ?45 years than among 35–44 years old respondents (6.7%) (P=0.04). Borrowing money (55.8%) and taking less preferred foods (53.3%) were the most common coping strategies. In conclusion, food insecurity is a significant problem among people living with HIV in Dar es Salaam which might significantly affect compliance to care and support. The study suggests that counselling of PLHIV before anti-retroviral treatment programmes should devise special strategies targeting those with low education, low income and low frequency of meals.

More than 80% of maternal deaths can be prevented if pregnant women access essential maternity care and assured of skilled attendance at childbirth as well as emergency obstetric care. The objective of this review was to analyse maternal mortality situation in Tanzania during the past 50 years and to identify efforts, challenges and opportunities of reducing it. This paper was written through desk review of key policy documents, technical reports, publications and available internet-based literature. From 1961 to 1990 maternal mortality ratio in Tanzania had been on a downward trend from 453 to 200 per 100,000 live births. However, from 1990’s there been an increasing trend to 578 per 100,000 live births. Current statistics indicate that maternal mortality ratio has dropped slightly in 2010 to 454 per 100,000 live births. Despite a high coverage (96%) in pregnant women who attend at least one antenatal clinic, only half of the women (51%) have access to skilled delivery. Coverage of emergence obstetric services is 64.5% and utilization of modern family planning method is 27%. Only about 13% of home deliveries access post natal check-up. Despite a number of efforts maternal mortality is still unacceptably high. Some of the efforts done  to reduce maternal mortality in Tanzania included the following initiatives: reproductive and child survival; increased skilled delivery; maternal death audit; coordination and integration of  different programs including maternal and child health services, family planning, malaria interventions, expanded program on immunization  and adolescent health and nutrition programmes. These initiatives are however challenged by inadequate access to maternal health care services. In order to considerably reduce maternal deaths some of recommended strategies include: (i) strengthening the health system to provide skilled attendance during child birth; (ii) upgrading rural health centres to provide emergency obstetric services; (iii) providing adolescent and male friendly family planning services; (iv) strengthening public–private partnership to ensure continuum of care; (v) supporting operational research to answer the immediate concerns of the health system; and (vi) strengthening community participation and women empowerment to take role of their own health and the family at large. In conclusion, maternal mortality ratio in Tanzania is unacceptably high and still very far from reaching the millennium development goals. Maternal health care services should focus on ensuring there is continuum of care through strengthening the health system; provision of good quality of health care in a well organized referral health system and operation research to support programme implementation."

We monitored the effect of four repeated MDAs with this combination, as implemented by the Tanzanian National Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programme (NLFEP), on the circulating filarial antigen (CFA) status of young schoolchildren. A new batch of Standard 1 pupils from 10 rural primary schools in Tanga Municipality were examined for CFA each year in September/October (691–848 children per survey; mean age of 7.5–8.1 years), from immediately before the first MDA until eight months after the fourth MDA. The overall pre-MDA prevalence of CFA was 25.2%. Only minor and non-significant change in prevalence was seen after the first two MDAs. However, this was followed by substantial and statistically significant decreases in subsequent surveys, and eight months after the fourth MDA the prevalence was only 6.4%. Continuous entomological surveillance in a village accommodating one of the schools showed progressive decrease in transmission right from the first MDA. The usefulness of screening young schoolchildren for CFA as a tool for monitoring the impact of MDA on LF transmission is discussed."

A total of 672 Anopheles gambiae sensu lato were collected. Of these, 661 (98.4%) were collected outdoor whereas few (1.6%) were collected indoor. The exit trap catch: mechanical aspirator catch ratio was 1:1.75. The overall indoor resting density of An. gambiae s.l. as determined by mechanical aspirator and exit trap was 0.7 and 0.5 mosquitoes per room, respectively. The overall density of the host-seeking as determined by bed net trap outdoor was 44.1 mosquitoes per person. A sample of 44 specimens taken randomly from morphologically identified An.gambiae s.l. population was further analyzed to species level using PCR techniques. Of these 44 specimens 26 (59%) and 18 (41%) were Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles gambiae sensu strictorespectively. This study contributes to the understanding of the distribution of malaria vectors with respect to species composition and their resting behaviour that could contribute to vector control operations in western Tanzania. A longitudinal study considering dry and wet seasons is recommended to provide more information on the seasonal distribution, abundance and biting behaviour of malaria vectors in the study area."

This review was conducted to provide comprehensive update on Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Tanzania, with particular attention devoted to trend of occurrence, epidemiological factors, socioeconomic impact and measures which were applied to its control. Information presented in this paper was obtained through extensive literature review. RVF occurred for the first time in Tanzania in 1930. This was followed by periodic epidemics of 10-20 years i.e. 1947, 1957, 1977, 1997 and 2007. During the latest disease outbreak in 2007 (the expanded to cover wider area of the country) 52.4% (n=21) of regions in Tanzania mainland were affected and majority (72.7%, n=11) of the regions had concurrent infections in human and animals. Phylogenetic comparison of nucleotide and amimo acid sequences revealed different virus strains between Kenya and Tanzania. Epidemiological factors that were considered responsible for the previous RVF epidemics in Tanzania included farming systems, climatic factors, vector activities and presence of large population of ruminant species, animal movements and food consumption habits. The disease caused serious effects on rural people's food security and household nutrition and on direct and indirect losses to livestock producers in the country. Psycho-social distress that communities went through was enormous, which involved the thinking about the loss of their family members and/or relatives, their livestock and crop production. Socially, the status of most livestock producers was eroded in their communities. Steps taken to combat epidemics included restriction of animal movements, ban of the slaughter of domestic ruminants and vaccination of livestock and health education."

However we have found that a high percentage of women referred from prevention of mother-to-child transmission services to the Care and Treatment Clinics (CTC) for HAART never registered at the CTCs. Few studies have focused on the motivating and deterring factors to presenting for HAART particularly in relation to women. This study seeks to remedy this gap in knowledge.

Results: The main deterrent to presenting for treatment appears to be fear of stigmatization including fear of ostracism from the community, divorce and financial distress. Participants indicated that individual counselling and interaction with other people living with HIV encourages women, who are disinclined to present for HAART, to do so, and that placing the entrance to the CTC so as to provide discrete access increases the accessibility of the clinic.                                                                                                                                                                   Conclusion: Combating stigma in the community, although it is essential, will take time. Therefore necessary steps towards encouraging HIV infected women to seek treatment include reducing self-stigma, assisting them to form empowering relationships and to gain financial independence and emphasis by example of the beneficial effect of treatment for themselves and for their children. Furthermore ensuring a discrete location of the CTC can increase its perceived accessibility."

In the area of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and HIV there is less weight given to understanding how evidence is successfully translated into practice. Policy issues in SRH can be controversial, influenced by political factors and shaped by context such as religion, ethnicity, gender and sexuality.

Results: The analysis emphasises the relationships and communications involved in using research to influence policy and practice and recognises a distinction whereby practice is not necessarily influenced as a result of policy change – especially in SRH – where there are complex interactions between policy actors.                                                                                     Conclusion: Both frameworks demonstrate how policy networks, partnership and advocacy are critical in shaping the extent to which research is used and the importance of on-going and continuous links between a range of actors to maximize research impact on policy uptake and implementation. The case-studies illustrate the importance of long-term engagement between researchers and policy makers and how to use evidence to develop policies which are sensitive to context: political, cultural and practical."

This is because traditional circumcision embodies local notions of bravery as anaesthetics are not used. This study was conducted to assess the acceptability of safe medical circumcision before the onset of sexual activity for HIV infection risk reduction in a traditionally circumcising community in Tanzania.                                                                                                                          Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among males and females aged 18-44 years in traditionally circumcising communities of Tarime District in Mara Region, North-eastern Tanzania. A face-to-face questionnaire was administered to females to collect information on the attitudes of women towards circumcision and the preferred age for circumcision. A similar questionnaire was administered to males to collect information on socio-demographic, preferred age for circumcision, factors influencing circumcision, client satisfaction, complications and beliefs surrounding the practice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Results: Results were available for 170 males and 189 females. Of the males, 168 (98.8%) were circumcised and 61 (36.3%) of those circumcised had the procedure done in the medical setting. Of those interviewed, 165 (97.1%) males and 179 (94.7%) females supported medical male circumcision for their sons. Of these, 107 (64.8%) males and 130 (72.6%) females preferred prepubertal medical male circumcision (12 years or less). Preference for prepubertal circumcision was significantly associated with non-Kurya ethnic group, circumcision in the medical setting and residence in urban areas for males in the adjusted analysis. For females, preference for prepubertal circumcision was significantly associated non-Kurya ethnic group and being born in urban areas in the adjusted analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Conclusions: There is a shift of preference from traditional male circumcision to medical male circumcision in this traditionally circumcising population. However, this preference has not changed the circumcision practices in the communities because of the community social pressure. Male circumcision national program should take advantage of this preference of medical male circumcision by introducing safe and affordable circumcision services and mobilising communities in a culturally sensitive manner to take up circumcision services."

Data came from participant observation, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with young people (14-24 years) and their parents. Socio-economic changes (education, changes in values, material needs provision) affected parent-young person relationships. Young people contributed to the economic needs of their families and parents receiving or expecting more support from their children exercised less behavioural control (in sexual and non-sexual matters of their children). Parents and young people spent less time together than in earlier generations. Parents reported that they thought their children were more knowledgeable about sexual and reproductive health than they were. As young people received more education and contributed more to their families' economic well being. they emerged as decision-makers in their own right and parental influence waned. Policy interventions addressing sexual and reproductive health among young people should consider family influence on young people as well as the influence of young people on their families and parental authority. Families, and particularly parents, should be supported to respond to the emerging challenges and changes in their families and the wider society."

There is a dearth of literature from sub-Saharan Africa on this subject. This paper examines parental control and monitoring and the implications of this on young people's sexual decision making in a rural setting in North-Western Tanzania.    Methods: This study employed an ethnographic research design. Data collection involved 17 focus group discussions and 46 in-depth interviews conducted with young people aged 14-24 years and parents/carers of young people within this age-group. Thematic analysis was conducted with the aid of NVIVO 7 software.                                                                                            Results: Parents were motivated to control and monitor their children's behavior for reasons such as social respectability and protecting them from undesirable sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes. Parental control and monitoring varied by family structure, gender, schooling status, a young person's contribution to the economic running of the family and previous experience of a SRH outcome such as unplanned pregnancy. Children from single parent families reported that they received less control compared to those from both parent families. While a father's presence in the family seemed important in controlling the activities of young people, a mother's did not have a similar effect. Girls especially those still schooling received more supervision compared to boys. Young women who had already had unplanned pregnancy were not supervised as closely as those who hadn't. Parents employed various techniques to control and monitor their children's sexual activities.                                                                                                                                                                                   Conclusions: Despite parents making efforts to control and monitor their young people's sexual behavior, they are faced with several challenges (e.g. little time spent with their children) which make it difficult for them to effectively monitor them. There is a need for interventions such as parenting skills building that might enable parents to improve their relationships with children. This would equip parents with the appropriate skills for positive guidance and monitoring of their children and avoid inappropriate parenting behaviour. As much as parents focus their attention on their school going daughters, there is a need to also remember the out-of-school young people as they are also vulnerable to adverse SRH outcomes."

The aim of the paper is to explore the changing sexual desires and behaviour of people on ART in Uganda over a 30 month period.                                                                 METHODS: This study employed longitudinal qualitative interviews with forty people starting ART. The participants received their ART, adherence education and counselling support from The AIDS Support Organisation (TASO). The participants were selected sequentially as they started ART, stratified by sex, ART delivery mode (clinic or home-based) and HIV progression stage (early or advanced) and interviewed at enrolment, 3, 6, 18 and 30 months of their ART use.                                                                                                                                                       RESULTS: Sexual desire changed over time with many reporting diminished desire at 3 and 6 months on ART compared to 18 and 30 months of use. The reasons for remaining abstinent included fear of superinfection or infecting others, fear that engaging in sex would awaken the virus and weaken them and a desire to adhere to the counsellors' health advice to remain abstinent. The motivations for resumption of sexual activity were: for companionship, to obtain material support, social norms around marriage, desire to bear children as well as to satisfy sexual desires. The challenges for most of the participants were using condoms consistently and finding a suitable sexual partner (preferably someone with a similar HIV serostatus) who could agree to have a sexual relationship with them and provide for their material needs.                                                                                                                           CONCLUSIONS: These findings point to the importance of tailoring counselling messages to the changing realities of the ART users' cultural expectations around child bearing, marriage and sexual desire. People taking ART require support so they feel comfortable to disclose their HIV status to sexual partners."

This study investigated potential risk factors and clustering in face of changing infection dynamics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Methods: Household survey data were collected in villages of rural Muheza district. Children aged between six months and thirteen years were tested for presence of malaria parasites using microscopy. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to identify significant risk factors for children. Geographical information systems combined with global positioning data and spatial scan statistical analysis were used to identify clusters of malaria.                                                                                                                                                        Results: Using an insecticide-treated mosquito net of any type proved to be highly protective against malaria (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96). Children aged five to thirteen years were at higher risk of having malaria than those aged under five years (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.01-2.91). The odds of malaria were less for females when compared to males (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.98). Two spatial clusters of significantly increased malaria risk were identified in two out of five villages.                                                                                                                                    Conclusions: This study provides evidence that recent declines in malaria transmission and prevalence may shift the age groups at risk of malaria infection to older children. Risk factor analysis provides support for universal coverage and targeting of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) to all age groups. Clustering of cases indicates heterogeneity of risk. Improved targeting of LLINs or additional supplementary control interventions to high risk clusters may improve outcomes and efficiency as malaria transmission continues to fall under intensified control."

This heterogeneity creates opportunities for targeted interventions but only if hot spots of malaria transmission can be easily identified. We determined spatial patterns in malaria transmission in a district in northeastern Tanzania, using malaria incidence data from a cohort study involving infants and household-level mosquito sampling data. The parasite prevalence rates and age-specific seroconversion rates (SCRs) of antibodies against Plasmodium falciparum antigens were determined in samples obtained from people attending health care facilities. Five clusters of higher malaria incidence were detected and interpreted as hot spots of transmission. These hot spots partially overlapped with clusters of higher mosquito exposure but could not be satisfactorily predicted by a probability model based on environmental factors. Small-scale local variation in malaria exposure was detected by parasite prevalence rates and SCR estimates for samples of health care facility attendees. SCR estimates were strongly associated with local malaria incidence rates and predicted hot spots of malaria transmission with 95% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Serological markers were able to detect spatial variation in malaria transmission at the microepidemiological level, and they have the potential to form an effective method for spatial targeting of malaria control efforts."

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Haydom Lutheran Hospital has provided ART to HIV-infected individuals since 2003. From February through May 2009, a cross-sectional virological efficacy survey was conducted among children (<15 years) who had completed >or=6 months of first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART. Genotypic resistance was determined in those with a viral load of >200 copies/mL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         RESULTS: Virological response was measured in 19 of 23 eligible children; 8 of 19 were girls and median age at ART initiation was 5 years (range 2-14 years). Median duration of ART at the time of the survey was 40 months (range 11-61 months). Only 8 children were virologically suppressed (<or=40 copies/mL), whereas 11 children had clinically relevant resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase gene. The most frequent mutations were M184V (n = 11), conferring resistance to lamivudine and emtricitabine, and Y181C (n = 4), G190A/S (n = 4) and K103N (n = 4), conferring resistance to NNRTIs. Of concern, three children had thymidine analogue mutations, associated with cross-resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Despite widespread resistance, however, only one child experienced a new WHO stage 4 event and none had a CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm(3)CONCLUSIONS: Among children on long-term ART in rural Tanzania, >50% harboured drug resistance. Results for children were markedly poorer than for adults attending the same programme, underscoring the need for improved treatment strategies for children in resource-limited settings."

PLoS One 5 (3): e9467.",Duration of protection against clinical malaria provided by three regimen of intermittent preventive treatment in Tanzanian children,malaria,PLoS One,2010,5,3,e9467,,11,,,,,,,,,"Background: Intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) is a new malaria control tool. However, it is uncertain whether IPTi works mainly through chemoprophylaxis or treatment of existing infections. Understanding the mechanism is essential for development of replacements for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) where it is no longer effective. This study investigated how protection against malaria given by SP, chlorproguanil-dapsone (CD) and mefloquine (MQ), varied with time since administration of IPTi.                                           Methods and Findings: A secondary analysis of data from a randomised, placebo-controlled trial in an area of high antifolate resistance in Tanzania was conducted. IPTi using SP, CD, MQ or placebo was given to 1280 infants at 2, 3 and 9 months of age. Poisson regression with random effects to adjust for potential clustering of malaria episodes within children was used to calculate incidence rate ratios for clinical malaria in defined time strata following IPTi. The short-acting antimalarial CD gave no protection against clinical malaria, whereas long-acting MQ gave two months of substantial protection (protective efficacy (PE) 73.1% (95% CI: 23.9, 90.5) and 73.3% (95% CI: 0, 92.9) in the first and second month respectively). SP gave some protection in the first month after treatment (PE 64.5% (95% CI: 10.6, 85.9)) although it did not reduce the incidence of malaria up to 12 months of age. There was no evidence of either long-term protection or increased risk of malaria for any of the regimens.                                                                                                                                                                           Conclusion: Post-treatment chemoprophylaxis appears to be the main mechanism by which IPTi protects children against malaria. Long-acting antimalarials are therefore likely to be the most effective drugs for IPTi, but as monotherapies could be vulnerable to development of drug resistance. Due to concerns about tolerability, the mefloquine formulation used in this study is not suitable for IPTi. Further investigation of combinations of long-acting antimalarials for IPTi is needed."

PfEMP1 attaches to the vascular lining and allows infected erythrocytes to avoid filtration through the spleen. Each parasite genome encodes about 60 different PfEMP1 variants, each PfEMP1 comprises several domains in its extracellular region, and the PfEMP1 repertoire in different parasites contains domain types that are serologically cross-reactive. In this longitudinal study, we followed 672 children living in an area of high malaria transmission during the first years of life and compared the acquisitions of antibodies to 32 Duffy-binding ligand-like (DBL) domains representing different types. For each child, we determined whether an antibody response to each domain was acquired before, after, or at the same time as responses to each of the other domains. We next used this information to calculate population-level odds ratios to measure the odds that antibodies to a given domain were acquired before antibodies to other domains. Odds ratios for 269 of the 496 possible domain combinations were statistically significant. Thus, the sequence in which individuals acquire antibodies to different PfEMP1 domains is ordered, and children in areas of endemicity first acquire antibodies to particular PfEMP1 domains encoded by the so-called group A and B/A var genes. The results imply that anti-PfEMP1 antibodies effectively structure PfEMP1 expression and play a major role in limiting parasite multiplication in the blood."

The adjusted prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to any of the four first-line drugs in new patients was 8.3%, while the prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 1.1%. In retreatment patients, the crude prevalence for any resistance and for MDR-TB was respectively 20.6% and 3.9%. The prevalence of drug resistance did not differ in relapse patients compared to failure patients. These estimates are among the lowest in those African countries with an estimated level of drug resistance in the last 5 years. The low levels of drug resistance in Tanzania are likely due to a well performing TB control programme and the absence of noticeable involvement of the private sector in TB treatment."

Since January 1999, an adolescent sexual and reproductive health (SRH) intervention has been implemented in ten randomly chosen intervention communities in rural Tanzania, within a community randomised trial (see below; NCT00248469). The intervention consisted of teacher-led, peer-assisted in-school education, youth-friendly health services, community activities, and youth condom promotion and distribution. Process evaluation in 1999–2002 showed high intervention quality and coverage. A 2001/2 intervention impact evaluation showed no impact on the primary outcomes of HIV seroincidence and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) seroprevalence but found substantial improvements in SRH knowledge, reported attitudes, and some reported sexual behaviours. It was postulated that the impact on “upstream” knowledge, attitude, and reported behaviour outcomes seen at the 3-year follow-up would, in the longer term, lead to a reduction in HIV and HSV-2 infection rates and other biological outcomes. A further impact evaluation survey in 2007/8 (?9 years post-intervention) tested this hypothesis.              Methods and Findings: This is a cross-sectional survey (June 2007 through July 2008) of 13,814 young people aged 15–30 y who had attended trial schools during the first phase of the MEMA kwa Vijana intervention trial (1999–2002). Prevalences of the primary outcomes HIV and HSV-2 were 1.8% and 25.9% in males and 4.0% and 41.4% in females, respectively. The intervention did not significantly reduce risk of HIV (males adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 0.91, 95%CI 0.50–1.65; females aPR 1.07, 95%CI 0.68–1.67) or HSV-2 (males aPR 0.94, 95%CI 0.77–1.15; females aPR 0.96, 95%CI 0.87–1.06). The intervention was associated with a reduction in the proportion of males reporting more than four sexual partners in their lifetime (aPR 0.87, 95%CI 0.78–0.97) and an increase in reported condom use at last sex with a non-regular partner among females (aPR 1.34, 95%CI 1.07–1.69). There was a clear and consistent beneficial impact on knowledge, but no significant impact on reported attitudes to sexual risk, reported pregnancies, or other reported sexual behaviours. The study population was likely to have been, on average, at lower risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections compared to other rural populations, as only youth who had reached year five of primary school were eligible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Conclusions: SRH knowledge can be improved and retained long-term, but this intervention had only a limited effect on reported behaviour and no significant effect on HIV/STI prevalence. Youth interventions integrated within intensive, community-wide risk reduction programmes may be more successful and should be evaluated."

(4th-generation assays by definition detect both HIV antigen and antibody.) The clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with false-positive HIV results were analyzed for 6,940 Tanzanian adolescents and young adults. A subsample of 284 Murex assay-negative and 240 false-positive serum samples were analyzed for immunological factors, including IgG antibodies to malaria and schistosoma parasites, heterophile antibodies, and rheumatoid factor (RF) titers. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). False-positive HIV test results were associated with evidence of other infections. False positivity was strongly associated with increasing levels of Schistosoma haematobium worm IgG1, with adolescents with optical densities in the top quartile being at the highest risk (adjusted OR = 40.7, 95% CI = 8.5 to 194.2 compared with the risk for those in the bottom quartile). False positivity was also significantly associated with increasing S. mansoni egg IgG1 titers and RF titers of ?80 (adjusted OR = 8.2, 95% CI = 2.8 to 24.3). There was a significant negative association between Murex assay false positivity and the levels of S. mansoni worm IgG1 and IgG2 and Plasmodium falciparum IgG1 and IgG4. In Africa, endemic infections may affect the specificities of immunoassays for HIV infection. Caution should be used when the results of 4th-generation HIV test results are interpreted for African adolescent populations."

The performance of the laboratories and the quality of malaria diagnosis have recently been assessed in 36 healthcare facilities in six districts of Tanzania. Questionnaires, checklists and observations were used to collect information on the availability and functional status of equipment as well as on laboratory personnel and their performance in malaria diagnosis. Together, the surveyed facilities had 112 laboratory staff [almost half (41.1%) of whom were laboratory assistants] and 57 microscopes. Twenty-seven (75.0%) of the healthcare facilities included in the survey had only one functional microscope each. Only seven (12.3%) of the assessed microscopes had been serviced in the previous 2 years. Of the 38 microscopists who were assessed, 24 (63.2%) were re-using microscope slides, 29 (73.5%) were producing bloodsmears of low quality, and 30 (79.0%) were using Field's stain. Although the facility microscopists gave similar results to experienced research microscopists when reading bloodsmears prepared by the survey team, using high-quality reagents (kappa=0.769), they appeared far less competent when reading smears stained using the reagents from the study laboratories (kappa=0.265-0.489). The quality of malaria diagnosis at healthcare facilities in Tanzania, which is generally poor (largely because of inadequate supplies of consumables and the limited skills of laboratory staff in the preparation of bloodsmears), urgently needs to be improved if the utilization of ACT is to be sustainable."

These patients are frequently HIV positive and have a higher mortality than smear-positive TB patients. Lack of access to diagnose Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia might be a contributing reason. We therefore assessed the prevalence of P. jirovecii by PCR in oral wash specimens among TB patients and healthy individuals in an HIV- and TB-endemic area of sub-Saharan Africa.                                                                                                                Methods: A prospective study of 384 patients initiating treatment for sputum smear-positive and smear-negative TB and 100 healthy household contacts and neighbourhood controls. DNA from oral wash specimens was examined by PCR for P. jirovecii. All patients delivered sputum for TB microscopy and culture. Healthy contacts and community controls were clinically assessed and all study subjects were HIV tested and had CD4 cell counts determined. Clinical status and mortality was assessed after a follow-up period of 5 months.             Results: 384 patients and 100 controls were included, 53% and 8% HIV positive respectively. A total number of 65 patients and controls (13.6%) were at definitive risk for PCP based on CD4 counts <200 cells per mm3 and no specific PCP prophylaxis. Only a single patient (0.3% of the patients) was PCR positive for P. jirovecii. None of the healthy household contacts or neighbourhood controls had PCR-detectable P. jirovecii DNA in their oral wash specimens regardless of HIV-status.                                                                                                                    Conclusions: The prevalence of P. jirovecii as detected by PCR on oral wash specimens was very low among TB patients with or without HIV and healthy individuals in Tanzania. Colonisation by P. jirovecii was not detected among healthy controls. The present findings may encourage diagnostic use of this non-invasive method."

With only a handful of countries having embarked on integrated NTD control, experience on how to develop and implement an efficient integrated programme is limited. Historically, national and global programmes were focused on the control of only one disease, usually through a comprehensive approach that involved several interventions including PCT. Overcoming the resulting disease-specific structures and thinking, and ensuring that the integrated programme is embedded within the existing health structures, pose considerable challenges to policy makers and implementers wishing to embark on integrated NTD control.

Mosquitoes were collected using CDC light-traps. Anopheles mosquitoes were identified by conventional keys. Anopheles gambiae complex were speciated using standard PCR method. Of the 562 specimens analysed by PCR 69% produced fragments equivalent to An. gambiae s.s.

The density of the three sibling species of An. gambiae complex also varied with the seasons. An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis were most predominant species during the start of the rainy season, but as season progresses, An. gambiae s.s. predominated. An. merus was only recorded during the short rainy season.

Methods: A community based cross-sectional survey involving 504 study participants was conducted between April and June 2007 using a structured questionnaire focusing on knowledge, attitudes and practices of community members in epidemic and non-epidemic villages about malaria transmission, signs and symptoms, treatment, prevention and control. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess determinants of malaria epidemics.                                                                                                                                                           Results: A total of 504 respondents (males = 36.9%) were interviewed. Overall, 453 (90.1%) mentioned malaria as the most important disease in the area. Four hundred and sixty four respondents (92.1%) knew that malaria is transmitted through mosquito bite. A total of 436 (86.7%), 306 (60.8%) and 162 (32.1%) mentioned fever, vomiting and loss of appetite as major symptoms/signs of malaria, respectively. Of those interviewed 328 (65.1%) remembered the recent outbreak of 2006. Of the 504 respondents interviewed, 296 (58.7%) reported that their households owned at least one mosquito net. Three hundred and ninety seven respondents (78.8%) knew insecticides used to impregnate bed nets. About two thirds (63.3%) of the respondents had at least a household member who suffered from malaria during the recent epidemic. During the 2006 outbreak, 278 people (87.2%) sought treatment from health facilities while 27 (8.5%) obtained drugs from drug shops and 10 (3.1%) used local herbs. Logistic regression analysis showed that household location and level of knowledge of cause of malaria were significant predictors of a household being affected by epidemic.

Our findings suggest that household location, ineffective usage of insecticide treated nets and knowledge gaps on malaria transmission, signs and symptoms, prevention and control predisposed communities in the district to malaria epidemics. It is important that health education packages are developed to address the identified knowledge gaps."

The MM trap significantly reduced the human biting rate with both laboratory-reared Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. The MM trap catch did not increase when a mosquito coil was burned but did significantly increase when a skin repellent was applied to the human bait. Microencapsulated repellent ankle bands did not increase the MM trap catch with either Cx. quinquefasciatus or An. gambiae s.s., although its combination with the trap was more effective at reducing bites by Cx. quinquefasciatus. The absence of the commercial attractant Lurex3 in traps significantly lowered the catch efficiency of Cx. quinquefasciatus even when the skin repellent was applied to volunteers. The results from this study showed that the use of a skin repellent and an attractant-baited trap can significantly reduce the human biting rate of both nuisance biting mosquitoes and malaria vectors.

In the case of malaria, most patients die in rural villages without healthcare facilities. An artesunate suppository that can be given by minimally skilled persons might be of value when patients suddenly become too ill for oral treatment but are several hours from a facility that can give injectable treatment for severe disease. In such situations, by default, no treatment is (or can be) given until the patient reaches a facility, making the placebo control design clinically relevant; alternative bioequivalence designs at the facility would misrepresent reality and risk incorrect conclusions. We describe the ethical issues underpinning a placebo-controlled trial in severe malaria. To protect patients and minimise risk, all patients were referred immediately to hospital so that each had a higher chance of prompt treatment through participation. There was no difference between artesunate and placebo in patients who reached clinic rapidly; among those who could not, a single artesunate suppository significantly reduced death or permanent disability, a finding of direct and indirect benefit to patients in participating villages and elsewhere"

In this round older age, lower gravidity, remarriage, duration of marriage, sexual activity before marriage, long interval between last birth and pregnancy and child death were all associated with infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Conclusions: HIV prevalence trends concur with results from a community-based cohort in the region. Correlates of HIV infection have also changed and more proximate, individual level factors are now more important, in line with the changing epidemiology of infection in this population."

Human brucellosis is a severely debilitating disease that requires prolonged treatment with a combination of antibiotics. The disease can result in permanent and disabling sequel, and results in considerable medical expenses in addition to loss of income due to loss of working hours. A study was conducted in Northern Tanzania to determine the risk factors for transmission of brucellosis to humans in Tanzania.         Methods: This was a matched case-control study. Any patient with a positive result by a competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) test for brucellosis, and presenting to selected hospitals with at least two clinical features suggestive of brucellosis such as headache, recurrent or continuous fever, sweating, joint pain, joint swelling, general body malaise or backache, was defined as a case. For every case in a district, a corresponding control was traced and matched by sex using multistage cluster sampling. Other criteria for inclusion as a control included a negative c-ELISA test result and that the matched individual would present to hospital if falls sick.                                                                                                                                                                    Results: Multivariable analysis showed that brucellosis was associated with assisted parturition during abortion in cattle, sheep or goat. It was shown that individuals living in close proximity to other households had a higher risk of brucellosis. People who were of Christian religion were found to have a higher risk of brucellosis compared to other religions. The study concludes that assisting an aborting animal, proximity to neighborhoods, and Christianity were associated with brucellosis infection. There was no association between human brucellosis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) serostatus. Protecting humans against contact with fluids and tissues during assisted parturition of livestock may be an important means of reducing the risk of transferring brucellosis from livestock to humans. These can be achieved through health education to the communities where brucellosis is common."

METHODS: Twenty communities, including 39 health facilities, were randomly allocated to the intervention or comparison arm. Health workers from the intervention arm were trained in the provision of youth-friendly health services, as part of a package of interventions. Independent process evaluations were conducted in health facilities, and simulated patients visited clinics using sexual and reproductive health problem scenarios. The impact on health facility attendances were assessed in 1998 (baseline) and 1999-2001. Reported sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms and use of health services were evaluated in young people in the trial cohort.                                                                                                                             RESULTS: The mean monthly attendance for STI symptoms per health facility, per month was .5 for young males and 1.0 for young females at baseline. Attendance by young males was greater in the intervention communities in 1999-2000 after adjustment for baseline differences (p = .005), and this difference increased over time (p-trend = .022). The mean difference in attendance was however relatively modest, at 1.1 per month in 2001 after adjustment for baseline (95% CI: .5, 1.7). There was weaker evidence of an intervention effect on attendance by young women (p = .087). Few condoms were distributed, although a greater number were distributed in intervention facilities (p = .008). Generally, intervention health workers tended to be less judgmental and provided more comprehensive information.                                                                                                                                                                                                 CONCLUSIONS: Training staff to provide more youth-friendly health services can increase the utilization of health services for suspected STIs by young people, especially among young men."

In Mwanza, 59 women were enrolled for 4 weeks and provided with 20 placebo gels. Weekly, women were given CDs to complete daily. At the final clinic visit, women attended a face-to-face interview (Clinic FFI) about their sexual behavior, and the gel use was accounted for (gel accountability (GA)). Comparisons were made between CD, Clinic FFI, and GA data. In-depth interviews following clinic visits elicited reasons for discrepancies in reports. Twice as many sex acts during 1 week were recorded in the CD (median 4) compared with the clinic FFI (median 2). At the clinic FFI, more women reported using the gel for each sex act (84% vs. 40%; P < 0.001) and vaginal washing for each sex act (98% vs. 56%; P < 0.001) compared with the CD. Over 4 weeks, 16.4% of women recorded sex during menstruation in CDs compared with 1.8% at the clinic visit (P = 0.01). The median number of gels used reported in the CDs was the same as the GA (10) with 59% agreement on the number used within +/-2 gels. Reasons for misreporting during clinic FFI were reported to have been poor recall, embarrassment, or misunderstanding. Inaccuracies in CDs were attributed to misunderstanding or poor recording. CDs elicited higher recording of sex acts and lower reporting of gel use than clinic FFIs, which has implications for measuring adherence during clinical trials. With clear instructions and support, coital dairies should be considered in future microbicide trial design."

We identified 34 SNPs in the proximal 7.3 kb region of the NOS2 promoter and inferred NOS2 promoter haplotypes based on genotyping 24 of these SNPs in a population of Tanzanian children with and without cerebral malaria. We identified 71 haplotypes; 24 of these haplotypes comprised 82% of the alleles. We determined whether NOS2 promoter haplotypes were associated with malaria severity in two groups of subjects from Dar es Salaam (N = 185 and N = 250) and in an inception cohort of children from Muheza-Tanga, Tanzania (N = 883). We did not find consistent associations of NOS2 promoter haplotypes with malaria severity or malarial anemia, although interpretation of these results was potentially limited by the sample size of each group. Furthermore, cytokine-induced NOS2 promoter activity determined using luciferase reporter constructs containing the proximal 7.3 kb region of the NOS2 promoter and the G-954C or C-1173T SNPs did not differ from NOS2 promoter constructs that lacked these polymorphisms. Taken together, these studies suggest that the relationship between NOS2 promoter polymorphisms and malaria severity is more complex than previously described."

Three doses of study or control (rabies) vaccines were administered intramuscularly at 1 month intervals. Solicited adverse events (AEs) were collected for 7 days after each vaccination. There was surveillance and reporting for unsolicited adverse events for 30 days after each vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded throughout the study period which lasted for 14 months after dose 1 in Korogwe, Tanzania and an average of 18 months post-dose 1 in Kilifi, Kenya. Blood samples for safety monitoring of haematological, renal and hepatic functions were taken at baseline, 3, 10 and 14 months after dose 1. A total of 894 children received RTS,S/AS01(E) or rabies vaccine between March and August 2007. Overall, children vaccinated with RTS,S/AS01(E) had fewer SAEs (51/447) than children in the control group (88/447). One SAE episode in a RTS,S/AS01(E) recipient and nine episodes among eight rabies vaccine recipients met the criteria for severe malaria. Unsolicited AEs were reported in 78% of subjects in the RTS,S/AS01(E) group and 74% of subjects in the rabies vaccine group. In both vaccine groups, gastroenteritis and pneumonia were the most frequently reported unsolicited AE. Fever was the most frequently observed solicited AE and was recorded after 11% of RTS,S/AS01(E) doses compared to 31% of doses of rabies vaccine. The candidate vaccine RTS,S/AS01(E) showed an acceptable safety profile in children living in a malaria-endemic area in East Africa.

Fairness is a key goal of priority-setting and Accountability for Reasonableness has emerged as a guiding framework for fair priority-setting. This paper describes the processes of setting health care priorities in Mbarali district, Tanzania, and evaluates the descriptions against Accountability for Reasonableness. Key informant interviews were conducted with district health managers, local government officials and other stakeholders using a semi-structured interview guide. Relevant documents were also gathered and group priority-setting in the district was observed. The results indicate that, while Tanzania has a decentralized public health care system, the reality of the district level priority-setting process was that it was not nearly as participatory as the official guidelines suggest it should have been. Priority-setting usually occurred in the context of budget cycles and the process was driven by historical allocation. Stakeholders’ involvement in the process was minimal. Decisions (but not the reasoning behind them) were publicized through circulars and notice boards, but there were no formal mechanisms in place to ensure that this information reached the public. There were neither formal mechanisms for challenging decisions nor an adequate enforcement mechanism to ensure that decisions were made in a fair and equitable manner. Therefore, priority-setting in Mbarali district did not satisfy all four conditions of Accountability for Reasonableness; namely relevance, publicity, appeals and revision, and enforcement. This paper aims to make two important contributions to this problematic situation. First, it provides empirical analysis of priority-setting at the district level in the contexts of low-income countries. Second, it provides guidance to decision-makers on how to improve fairness, legitimacy, and sustainability of the priority-setting process."

Materials and Methods: Data was obtained from 143 patients admitted in 2004 for treatment for HAT at Kaliua Health Centre, Urambo District. The direct medical and other indirect costs incurred by individual patients and by the health services were calculated. DALYs were estimated using methods recommended by the Global Burden of Disease Project as well as those used in previous rhodesiense HAT estimates assuming HAT under reporting of 45%, a figure specific for Tanzania.

The costs of treating 143 patients in terms of admission costs, diagnosis, hospitalization and sleeping sickness drugs were estimated at US$ 15,514, of which patients themselves paid US$ 3,673 and the health services US$ 11,841. The burden in terms of indirect non-medical costs for the 143 patients was estimated at US$ 9,781.                                                                                                                                                                                    Conclusions: This study shows that HAT imposes a considerable burden on affected rural communities in Tanzania and stresses the urgent need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates tailored to particular rural settings in countries like Tanzania where a considerable number of infectious diseases are prevalent and, due to their focal nature, are often concentrated in certain locations where they impose an especially high burden"

In this study, metabolic-based mechanisms conferring permethrin (pyrethroid) resistance were investigated in Anopheles arabiensis of Lower Moshi, Kilimanjaro region of north-eastern Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Methods: WHO susceptibility test kits were used to detect resistance to permethrin in An. arabiensis. The levels and mechanisms of permethrin resistance were determined using CDC bottle bioassays and microplate (biochemical) assays. In bottle bioassays, piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and s,s,s-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF) were used as synergists to inhibit mixed function oxidases and non-specific esterases respectively. Biochemical assays were carried out in individual mosquitoes to detect any increase in the activity of enzymes typically involved in insecticide metabolism (mixed function oxidases, ?- and ?-esterases).                                                                                                                                                                 Results: Anopheles arabiensis from the study area was found to be partially resistant to permethrin, giving only 87% mortality in WHO test kits. Resistance ratios at KT50 and KT95 were 4.0 and 4.3 respectively. The permethrin resistance was partially synergized by DEF and by PBO when these were mixed with permethrin in bottle bioassays and was fully synergized when DEF and PBO were used together. The levels of oxidase and ?-esterase activity were significantly higher in An. arabiensis from Lower Moshi than in the laboratory susceptible strain. There was no difference in ?-esterase activity between the two strains.                                                                                                                                                                                                     Conclusion: Elevated levels of mixed function oxidases and ?-esterases play a role in detoxification of permethrin in the resistant An. arabiensis population of Lower Moshi."

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of anaemia and organomegaly and their relationship with single and multiple parasitic infections among schoolchildren in Sengerema District in north?west Tanzania. This cross sectional study involved 400 schoolchildren. Anaemia and organomegaly were determined using HemoCue photometer and clinical palpation, respectively. A Kato?Katz technique was employed to screen faecal samples for Schistosoma mansoni and other intestinal helminths. Giemsa stained thick and thin blood smears were examined for malaria parasites. The prevalence of anaemia was 19.5% (<11g/d) and majority of the children had mild (22.8%) to moderate (36.6%) anaemia. Organomegaly (palpable spleen and liver) was detected in 41% of the children and hepatomegaly was the most common (53.7%). The prevalence of S. mansoni, hookworm and P. falciparum were 64.3%, 38% and 13.5% respectively. No significant relationship was observed between single and multiple parasitic infections with anaemia and organomegaly. Logistic regression analysis revealed that increased infections intensity of S. mansoni was significantly associated with an increased likelihood of hookworm concomitant infections (P<0.002). In conclusion, the data confirm that malaria, intestinal schistosomiasis and hookworm are common among school children but are not associated with anaemia and organomegaly. Further longitudinal studies are recommended to establish any such association. The prevalence of parasitic co?infections among schoolchildren calls for an integrated control approach to reduce the burden of these infections.  "

In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum-malaria, intestinal schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminth infections, and the respective co-infections, among schoolchildren in northwest Tanzania. A cross sectional study was conducted among schoolchildren living in villages located close to the shores of Lake Victoria. The Kato Katz technique was employed to screen faecal samples for S. mansoni and soil-transmitted helminth eggs. Giemsa stained thick and thin blood smears were analysed for the presence of malaria parasites. Of the 400 children included in the study, 218 (54.5%) were infected with a single parasite species, 116 (29%) with two or more species, and 66 (16.5%) had no infection. The prevalences of P. falciparum and S. mansoni were 13.5% (95% CI, 10.2-16.8), and 64.3% (95% CI, 59.6-68.9) respectively. Prevalence of hookworm infection was 38% (95% CI, 33.2-42.8). A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura were not detected. Of the children 26.5% (95% CI, 21.9-30.6) that harbored two parasite species, combination of S. mansoni and hookworm co-infections was the most common (69%). Prevalence of S. mansoni - P. falciparum co-infections was 22.6% (95%CI, 15.3-31.3) and that of hookworm - P. falciparum co-infections 5.7% (95%CI, 2.6-12.8). Prevalence of co-infection of P. falciparum, S. mansoni and hookworm was 2.8% (95%CI, 1.15-4.4). Multiple parasitic infections are common among schoolchildren in rural northwest Tanzania. These findings can be used for the design and implementation of sound intervention strategies to mitigate morbidity and co-morbidity."

Various agro-ecosystems and crop production systems have an impact on mosquito productivity, and hence malaria transmission intensity. This study was carried out to determine spatial and temporal variations in anopheline mosquito population and malaria transmission intensity in five villages, representing different agro-ecosystems in Mvomero district, Tanzania, so as to provide baseline information for malaria interventions. The agro-ecosystems consisted of irrigated sugarcane, flooding rice irrigation, non-flooding rice irrigation, wet savannah and dry savannah. In each setting, adult mosquitoes were sampled monthly using light traps recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from August 2004 to July 2005. A total of 35,702 female mosquitoes were collected. Anopheles gambiae sensu lato was the most abundant (58.9%) mosquito species. An. funestus accounted for 12.0% of the mosquitoes collected. There was a substantial village to village variation and seasonality in the density of Anopheles mosquito population, with peaks in May towards the end of the warm and rainy season. Significantly larger numbers of anophelines were collected from traditional flooding rice irrigation ecosystem (70.7%) than in non-flooding rice irrigation (8.6%), sugarcane (7.0%), wet savannah (7.3%) and dry savannah (6.4%). The overall sporozoite rates for An. gambiae and An. funestus were 3.4% and 2.3%, respectively. The combined overall sporozoite rate (An. gambiae+An. funestus) was 3.2%. The mean annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR) for An. gambiae s.l. was 728 infective bites per person per year and this was significantly higher in traditional flooding rice irrigation (1351) than in other agro-ecosystems. The highest EIRs for An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus were observed during May 2005 (long rainy season) and December 2004 (short rainy season), respectively. The findings support the evidence that malaria transmission risk varies even between neighbouring villages and is influenced by agro-ecosystems. This study therefore, demonstrates the need to generate spatial and temporal data on transmission intensity on smaller scales taking into consideration agro-ecosystems that will identify area-specific transmission intensity to guide targeted control of malaria operations."

A total of 661 adult males and females were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Most respondents (85.6%) were engaged in crop production. Significantly, a larger proportion (55.2%) of the respondents had primary school education (P<0.001). Majority (88.2%) respondents described malaria as the most important public health problem. However, only 48.2% of the respondents had high knowledge of malaria. The level of knowledge on malaria was associated with level of education of the respondent. Those who had attended at least primary school education were more knowledgeable that those without formal education. A significantly larger proportion (67%) of the respondents experienced most malaria episodes during the rainy season (P<0.001). Respondents with low knowledge on malaria experienced 2.3 times more malaria cases in their households than those with higher knowledge. Respondents with low knowledge preferred to seek care from health facilities (OR: 7.28) than those with high knowledge (OR: 0.15). Rice farming was significantly associated with malaria transmission compared to either maize or sugarcane farming (P<0.001). Cattle, sheep and goats were the domestic animals most frequently incriminated to create aquatic habitats for mosquito breeding. Householders with formal education (OR: 4.6, CI: 1.33-15.89, P-value=0.016) and higher knowledge (OR: 1.7, CI: 1.15-2.55, P-value=0.008) reported to incur large losses when having a malaria case than those without education/low knowledge. Majority (60.2%) of the respondent owned at least an insecticide treated mosquito net (ITN). Respondents with higher knowledge of malaria were likely to own at least an ITN than those with low knowledge (P<0.001). In conclusion, the knowledge on malaria and its linkage with agriculture among farming communities in Mvomero District is low. Malaria is a complex health problem and its control approach needs understanding of the environmental factors associated with agricultural practices. It therefore is important that education and communication messages on malaria targeting farming communities take into consideration local agricultural practices."

Recently, it has been reported that the burden of malaria in some parts of Africa has declined. However, community-based longitudinal data are sparse and the reasons for the apparent decline are not well understood.      METHODS: Malaria prevalence and morbidity have been monitored in two villages in north-eastern Tanzania; a lowland village and a highland village from 2003 to 2008. Trained village health workers treated presumptive malaria with the Tanzanian first-line anti-malarial drug and collected blood smears that were examined later. The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia across years was monitored through cross-sectional surveys.                                                                                                                                                                                           RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia in the lowland village decreased from 78.4% in 2003 to 13.0% in 2008, whereas in the highland village, the prevalence of parasitaemia dropped from 24.7% to 3.1% in the same period. Similarly, the incidence of febrile malaria episodes in the two villages dropped by almost 85% during the same period and there was a marked reduction in the number of young children who suffered from anaemia in the lowland village.                                                                                                                                                      CONCLUSION: There has been a marked decline in malaria in the study villages during the past few years. This decline is likely to be due to a combination of factors that include improved access to malaria treatment provided by the trained village helpers, protection from mosquitoes by increased availability of insecticide-impregnated bed nets and a reduced vector density. If this decline in malaria morbidity is sustained, it will have a marked effect on the disease burden in this part of Tanzania."

This paper attempts to estimate the rates of over diagnosis of malaria among children attending dispensaries in rural Tanzania and examines the potential cost implications of improving the quality of diagnosis.                       METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:  The magnitude of over diagnosis of malaria was estimated by comparing the proportion of outpatient attendees of all ages clinically diagnosed as malaria to the proportion of attendees having a positive malaria rapid diagnostic test over a two month period. Pattern of causes of illness observed in a <2 year old cohort of children over one year was compared to the pattern of causes of illness in <5 year old children recorded in the routine health care system during the same period. Drug and diagnostic costs were modelled using local and international prices. Over diagnosis of malaria by the routine outpatient care system compared to RDT confirmed cases of malaria was highest among <5 year old children in the low transmission site (RR 17.9, 95% CI 5.8-55.3) followed by the >or=5 year age group in the lower transmission site (RR 14.0 95%CI 8.2-24.2). In the low transmission site the proportion of morbidity attributable to malaria was substantially lower in <2 year old cohort compared to children seen at routine care system. (0.08% vs 28.2%; p<0.001). A higher proportion of children were diagnosed with ARI in the <2 year old cohort compared to children seen at the routine care system ( 42% vs 26%; p<0.001). Using a RDT reduced overall drug and diagnostic costs by 10% in the high transmission site and by 15% in the low transmission site compared to total diagnostic and drug costs of treatment based on clinical judgment in routine health care system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    IMPLICATIONS: The introduction of RDTs is likely to lead to financial savings. However, improving diagnosis to one disease may lead to over diagnosis of another illness. Quality improvement is complex but introducing RDTs for the diagnosis of malaria is a good start."

We collected clinical information and blood for point of care tests, culture, and diagnosis of malaria and HIV. We analyzed the clinical features on admission and outcome by laboratory-confirmed diagnosis. Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from the blood of 156 (10%) children, of which 14 (9%) were S. typhi, 45 (29%) were NTS and 97 (62%) were other pathogenic bacteria. Invasive salmonellosis accounted for 59/156 (38%) bacteremic children. Children with typhoid fever were significantly older and presented with a longer duration of fever. NTS infections were significantly associated with prior antimalarial treatment, malarial complications and with a high risk for death. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Invasive salmonellosis, particularly NTS infection, is an important cause of febrile disease among hospitalized children in our rural Tanzanian setting. Previous studies showed considerable variation in the case fraction of S. typhi and NTS infections. Certain suggestive clinical features (such as older age and long duration of fever for typhoid whereas concomitant malaria, anemia, jaundice and hypoglycemia for NTS infection) may be used to distinguish invasive salmonellosis from other severe febrile illness."

Qualitative data were collected in the districts of Mufindi in Iringa Region and Mkuranga in Coast Region through 1) focus group discussions (FGDs) with pregnant women and mothers to infants and 2) exit-interviews with pregnant women identified at ANC clinics. Data were analyzed manually using qualitative content analysis methodology. FGD participants and interview respondents identified the following key limiting factors for women's use of ANC services: 1) costs in terms of money and time associated with accessing ANC clinics, 2) the presence of more or less official user-fees for some services within the ANC package, and 3) service providers' application of fines, penalties and blame when failing to adhere to service schedules. Interestingly, the time associated with travelling long distances to ANC clinics and ITN retailers and with waiting for services at clinic-level was a major factor of discouragement in the health seeking behaviour of pregnant women because it seriously affected their domestic responsibilities. A variety of resource-related factors were shown to affect the health seeking behaviour of pregnant women in rural Tanzania. Thus, accessibility to ANC services was hampered by direct and indirect costs, travel distances and waiting time. Strengthening of user-fee exemption practices and bringing services closer to the users, for example by promoting community-directed control of selected public health services, including IPTp, are urgently needed measures for increasing equity in health services in Tanzania."

METHODS: Using frozen section histology in Tanzania (high transmission area), we establish a novel grading scheme to separately quantify inflammation and pigment deposition during PM (n=102). To generalize this method, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded placental samples from Karen women in Thailand (low transmission area) were selected from among those with documented antenatal parasitemia near term (n=18).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    RESULTS: In the Tanzanian cohort, the inflammation and pigment deposition scores were independently associated with birth weight, and the inflammation score was associated with chemokine levels. In the smaller cohort from Thailand, both inflammation and pigment scores were associated with birth weight, and the pigment score had an inverse trend with the number of antenatal clinic visits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  CONCLUSIONS: This semiquantitative pathological grading scheme is simple to implement yet captures information that is associated with outcomes in Asia and Africa, and therefore should facilitate the comparison and standardization of results among clinical trials across areas of differing endemicity."

Global efforts at improving care and treatment has included scaling up use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). In Tanzania, HIV care and treatment program, including the provision of free ART started in 2004 with a pilot program at Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam. This study describes the socio-demographic and clinical features of patients enrolled at the care and treatment clinic at MNH, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: A cross-sectional study looking at baseline characteristics of patients enrolled at the HIV clinic at MNH between June 2004 - Dec 2005 compared to those enrolled between 2006 and September 2008.      Results: Of all enrolled patients, 2408 (58.5%) were used for analysis. More females than males were attending the clinic. Their baseline median CD4 cell count was low (136 cells/?l) with 65.7% having below 200 cells/?l. Females had higher CD4 cell counts (150 cells/?l) than males (109 cells/?l) p < 0.001). The most common presenting features were skin rash and/or itching (51.6%); progressive weight loss (32.7%) and fever (23.4). Patients enrolled earlier at the clinic (2004-5) were significantly more symptomatic and had significantly lower CD4 cell count (127 cells/?l) compared to CD4 of 167 cells/?l in those seen later (2006-8) (p < 0.001).                                                                                                                                                           Conclusion: Patients enrolled to the MNH HIV clinic were predominantly females, and presented with advanced immune-deficiency. Improved access to HIV care and treatment services seems to be associated with patients' early presentation to the clinics in the course of HIV disease.

Despite recent success in improving TB cure rates, diagnosis and case detection remains a major obstacle to its control. In this study the usefulness of four fixatives in improving Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) microscopy diagnosis of TB was assessed. The study was conducted at Muhimbili National Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A total of 560 cases of peripheral lymphadenopathies had fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) done. Out of these cases, 110 (19.6%) were diagnosed by ZN stain to be TB lymphadenitis. Different types of fixatives in diagnosis of TB were compared. Each specimen was smeared and fixed on to four glass slides using four fixatives (95% ethyl alcohol, Acetone, Carnoy's fluid and 10% neutral buffered formalin), and one slide fixed using air dried method. Subsequently, Zeelh-Neelsen (ZN) stained slides were examined under a microscope for AFB. Of the 101 cases, 53 were TB adenitis, as diagnosed by AFB smear microscopy on ZN stained slides, and 48 were adenitis due to other causes. The diagnostic yield of AFB was highest when using 95% ethyl alcohol which was observed to be 30.2% (16/53) when AFB was 1+, 58.5% (31/53) when AFB was 2+ and 11.3% (6/53) when AFB was 3+, and making a total yield of 100% (53/53). Air dried smears also gave a relatively high yield with total yield of 94.3% (50/53). When 95% ethyl alcohol was used as a gold standard fixative, air dried slides had highest sensitivity (94.3%) and all fixatives had high specificity. The study has demonstrated that 95% ethyl alcohol is an excellent fixative. It is therefore recommended that 95% ethyl alcohol be used to form part of the routine fixation of FNAC smears."

Main outcome measures:  Sensitivity and specificity of WHO guidelines in diagnosing invasive bacterial disease; susceptibility of isolated organisms to recommended antimicrobials. Results: Over one year, 3639 children were enrolled and 184 (5.1%) died; 2195 (60.3%) were blood slide positive for Plasmodium falciparum, 341 (9.4%) had invasive bacterial disease, and 142 (3.9%) were seropositive for HIV. The prevalence of invasive bacterial disease was lower in slide positive children (100/2195, 4.6%) than in slide negative children (241/1444, 16.7%). Non-typhi Salmonella was the most frequently isolated organism (52/100 (52%) of organisms in slide positive children and 108/241 (45%) in slide negative children). Mortality among children with invasive bacterial disease was significantly higher (58/341, 17%) than in children without invasive bacterial disease (126/3298, 3.8%) (P<0.001), and this was true regardless of the presence of P falciparum parasitaemia. The sensitivity and specificity of WHO criteria in identifying invasive bacterial disease in slide positive children were 60.0% (95% confidence interval 58.0% to 62.1%) and 53.5% (51.4% to 55.6%), compared with 70.5% (68.2% to 72.9%) and 48.1% (45.6% to 50.7%) in slide negative children. In children with WHO criteria for invasive bacterial disease, only 99/211(47%) of isolated organisms were susceptible to the first recommended antimicrobial agent.                                                                         Conclusions: In an area exposed to high transmission of malaria, current WHO guidelines failed to identify almost a third of children with invasive bacterial disease, and more than half of the organisms isolated were not susceptible to currently recommended antimicrobials. Improved diagnosis and treatment of invasive bacterial disease are needed to reduce childhood mortality"

The African Malaria Network Trust (AMANET) is a pan-African non-governmental organization that sponsors and technically supports malaria vaccine trials in various African countries.                                                                                                                                                                                                         Case description: AMANET sponsored phase Ib or IIb clinical trials of several malaria vaccine candidates in various Africa countries. In Burkina Faso, Mali and Tanzania trials of the merozoite surface protein 3 -- in its Long Synthetic Peptide configuration (MSP3 LSP) -- were conducted. In Mali, the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) was tested, while a hybrid of glutamate rich protein (GLURP) and MSP3 (GMZ2) was tested in Gabon. AMANET recognizes the importance of engaging with the communities from which trial participants are drawn, hence community engagement was given priority in all project activities conducted in the various countries.                                                                                                                                Discussion and evaluation: Existing local social systems were used to engage the communities from which clinical trial participants were drawn. This article focuses on community engagement activities employed at various AMANET-supported clinical trial sites in different countries, highlighting subtle differences in the approaches used.

It drew on participant observation in nine villages, group discussions and interviews in three others, and 16 health facility simulated patient visits from 1999-2002. Fertility was highly valued, but out-of-wedlock pregnancies were stigmatized. Many girls used traditional contraception, such as wearing charms or drinking ash solutions. Young single mothers sometimes used modern contraception, including Depo Provera, because injections were accessible, private, and infrequent. However, use was ambivalent and inconsistent for fear of side effects, such as infertility (hormonal contraceptives) and reduced male pleasure (condoms). Newly married women tried to conceive immediately. Traditional treatments were used for infertility, miscarriage, or difficult deliveries. These were attributed to physical causes (sexually transmitted infections; contraception; abortion) and/or supernatural causes (God’s will; witchcraft; ancestral punishment). Improved reproductive health education and services are greatly needed. The potential of condoms to protect future fertility should be emphasised."

This qualitative study explored adherence in a randomized controlled trial of herpes suppressive therapy to reduce HIV acquisition and infectivity among 1305 Tanzanian women. The trial found participants completed 72% of visits on treatment; 52-56% of women on treatment had > or = 90% adherence by pill count estimate; and between six and nine months 30/86 (35%) of urine samples from acyclovir recipients tested acyclovir negative, and 7/86 (8%) from placebo recipients tested acyclovir positive. Twenty in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted after 30 months with respondents randomly selected from ""acyclovir negative"" acyclovir recipients and ""acyclovir positive"" placebo recipients, or by preliminary pill count adherence categories (""under users,"" ""good users,"" and ""over users""). Almost all respondents reported appropriate adherence and positive trial attitudes, e.g., trusting staff, appreciating services, perceiving pills as beneficial. Fourteen understood placebo use, and six understood the trial purpose. Notably, 5/9 acyclovir recipients and 1/11 placebo recipients believed their pills had treated pre-existing sexually transmitted infections. Limited understanding did not negatively affect reported adherence. Reported adherence problems usually related to illness, travel, and/or family obligations (e.g., husband's disapproval). ""Acyclovir positive"" placebo recipients denied taking other participants' pills. The IDIs also did not resolve discrepant reports of pill loss or theft. Biomedical HIV interventions often have strong behavioral components that require close attention during intervention development, trial design, and process and impact evaluation. This study identified topics which warrant further consideration, including: information reinforcement and comprehension assessment throughout a trial for long-term participant understanding; involving partners in adherence promotion activities; strategizing with participants to maintain adherence during familial illnesses or other crises; and close monitoring, identification, and follow-up of (1) individuals with discrepant biological tests, and (2) other sources of the treatment in the trial area. Methodological research is also needed to improve adherence measures"

Household surveys were conducted with 408 randomly selected respondents from 10 villages and qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. Results show that respondents are well aware of the links between mosquitoes, the environment, and malaria. Most respondents stated that cleaning the environment around the home, clearing vegetation around the home, or draining stagnant water can reduce mosquito populations, and 63% of respondents reported performing at least one of these techniques to protect themselves from malaria. It is clear that many respondents believe that these environmental management practices are effective malaria control methods, but the actual efficacy of these techniques for controlling populations of vectors or reducing malaria prevalence in the varying ecological habitats in Mvomero is unknown. Further research should be conducted to determine the effects of different environmental management practices on both mosquito populations and malaria transmission in this region, and increased participation in effective techniques should be promoted."

Although HIV infection was associated with a 1.7-kg lower weight and a 0.6-kg/m(2) lower BMI (with deficits in both AMA and AFA) among males, it was not associated with any such deficits among the female subjects. Elevated serum ACT was found to be a negative predictor of BMI, AMA and AFA, partially explaining the effects of the PTB but not those of the HIV.

The majority of participants attributed young people's sexual and reproductive health risks to a combination of modernisation (and its impact on family and community life), socioeconomic conditions, social norms in rural/lakeshore communities and the difficulties parents and other adults face in raising adolescents in contemporary Tanzania. Community life has limited opportunities for positive development but contains many risky situations. Young and old agreed that parents have a strong influence on young people's health but are failing in their parental responsibility. Parents acknowledged the multiple influences on sexual risk behaviour. They expressed a need for knowledge and skills related to parenting so that they can address these influences both through family- and community-based strategies."

In order to have a significant, long-term impact, these initiatives must be implemented over a sustained period and on a large scale. We conducted a process evaluation of the 10-fold scale up of an evaluated youth-friendly services intervention in Mwanza Region, Tanzania, in order to identify key facilitating and inhibitory factors from both user and provider perspectives. The intervention was scaled up in two training rounds lasting six and 10 months. This process was evaluated through the triangulation of multiple methods: (i) a simulated patient study; (ii) focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews with health workers and trainers; (iii) training observations; and (iv) pre- and post-training questionnaires. These methods were used to compare pre- and post-intervention groups and assess differences between the two training rounds. Between 2004 and 2007, local government officials trained 429 health workers. The training was well implemented and over time, trainers' confidence and ability to lead sessions improved. The district-led training significantly improved knowledge relating to HIV/AIDS and puberty (RR ranged from 1.06 to 2.0), attitudes towards condoms, confidentiality and young people's right to treatment (RR range: 1.23-1.36). Intervention health units scored higher in the family planning and condom request simulated patient scenarios, but lower in the sexually transmitted infection scenario than the control health units. The scale up faced challenges in the selection and retention of trained health workers and was limited by various contextual factors and structural constraints. Youth-friendly services interventions can remain well delivered, even after expansion through existing systems. The scaling-up process did affect some aspects of intervention quality, and our research supports others in emphasizing the need to train more staff (both clinical and non-clinical) per facility in order to ensure youth-friendly services delivery. Further research is needed to identify effective strategies to address structural constraints and broader social norms that hampered the scale up."

Results: Despite a successful ten-fold scale-up of intervention activities in three years, full integration into LGA systems did not materialize. LGAs contributed significant human resources but limited finances; the NGO retained control over finances and decision-making and LGAs largely continued to view activities as NGO driven. Embedding of technical assistants (TAs) in the LGAs contributed to capacity building among district implementers, but may paradoxically have hindered project integration, because TAs were unable to effectively transition from an implementing to a facilitating role. Operation of NGO administration and financial mechanisms also hindered integration into district systems.                      Conclusions: Sustainable intervention scale-up requires operational, financial and psychological integration into local government mechanisms. This must include substantial time for district systems to try out implementation with only minimal NGO support and modest output targets. It must therefore go beyond the typical three- to four-year project cycles. Scale-up of NGO pilot projects of this nature also need NGOs to be flexible enough to adapt to local government planning cycles and ongoing evaluation is needed to ensure strategies employed to do so really do achieve full intervention integration."

Qualitative interviews and focus group discussions with teachers, head teachers, ward education coordinators and school committees from eight schools took place before, during and after intervention implementation. The results were triangulated with observations of training sessions and training questionnaires. The training was well implemented and led to some key improvements in teachers' ASRH knowledge, attitudes and perceived self-efficacy, with substantial improvements in knowledge about reproductive biology and attitudes towards confidentiality. The trained teachers were more likely to consider ASRH a priority in schools and less likely to link teaching ASRH to the early initiation of sex than non-trained teachers. Facilitating factors included teacher enjoyment, their recognition of training benefits, the participatory teaching techniques, support from local government as well as the structured nature of the intervention. Challenges included differential participation by male and female teachers, limited availability of materials and high turnover of trained teachers."

Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 25 FLs purposively selected to account for all the denominations present in the area. Data was organised into themes using the software package NVIVO-7. The field work guidelines were tailored as new topics emerged and additional codes progressively added to the coding frame.                                                     Results: Traditional healers (THs) and FLs were often reported as antagonists but duality prevailed and many FLs simultaneously believed in traditional healing. Inter-denomination mobility was high and guided by pragmatism. Praying for the sick was a common practice and over one third of respondents said that prayer could cure HIV. Being HIV-positive was often seen as ""a punishment from God"" and a consequence of sin. As sinning could result from ""the work of Satan"", forgiveness was possible, and a ""reconciliation with God"" deemed as essential for a favourable remission of the disease. Several FLs believed that ""evil spirits"" inflicted through witchcraft could cause the disease and claimed that they could cast ""demons"" away. While prayers could potentially cure HIV ""completely"", ART use was generally not discouraged because God had ""only a part to play"". The perceived potential superiority of spiritual options could however lead some users to interrupt treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                    Conclusions: The roll-out of ART is taking place in a context in which the new drugs are competing with a diversity of existing options. As long as the complementarities of prayers and ART are not clearly and explicitly stated by FLs, spiritual options may be interpreted as a superior alternative and contribute to hampering adherence to ART. In contexts where ambivalent attitudes towards the new drugs prevail, enhancing FLs understanding of ART's strengths and pitfalls is an essential step to engage them as active partners in ART scale-up programs."

This study aimed at assessing natural acquisition of antibodies to MSP3 in individuals living in an area with different malaria transmission intensity in preparation for malaria vaccine trials. The study was conducted in individuals aged 0-19 years from villages located in lowland, intermediate and highland strata in Korogwe district, northeastern Tanzania. Blood samples from 492 study participants were collected between May and June 2006 for malaria diagnosis and immunological investigations.

Less than half (44.8%) of febrile children were taken to government facilities. Almost one-third (37.6%; 95% CI 33.1–42.1) of febrile children had prompt access to ACT. Care-seeking from a government facility was the overriding factor, increasing the likelihood of prompt access to an ACT 18 times (OR 17.7; 95% CI 10.55–29.54; adjusted OR 16.9; 95% CI 10.06–28.28). Caretakers from the better-off household (3rd–5th quintiles) were more likely to seek care from government facilities (OR 3.66; 95% CI 2.56–5.24; adjusted OR 1.80; 95% CI 1.18–2.76). The majority of antimalarials accessed by the poor were ineffective [86.0%; 295/343], however, they paid more for them (median Tsh 500) compared to the better-offs (median Tsh 0).                                                Conclusions: Prompt access to ACT among febrile children was unacceptably low, due mainly to limited availability of subsidised ACT at the location where most caretakers sought care. There is urgent need to accelerate implementation of strategies that will ensure availability of ACT at an affordable price in remote rural areas, where the burden of malaria is highest."

Here we present the first detailed study on the effect of 3 repeated MDAs with this drug combination, as implemented by the Tanzanian National Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programme (NLFEP).                                                                                                                                                                                          Methodology/Principal Findings: Infection and transmission was monitored during a five-year period (one pre-intervention and four post-intervention years) in a highly endemic community (Kirare village) in north-eastern Tanzania. The vectors were Anopheles gambiae, An. funestus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. After start of intervention, human microfilaraemia initially decreased rapidly and statistically significant (prevalence by 21.2% and 40.4%, and mean intensity by 48.4% and 73.7%, compared to pre-treatment values after the first and second MDA, respectively), but thereafter the effect levelled off. The initial decrease in microfilaraemia led to significant decreases in vector infection and vector infectivity rates and thus to a considerable reduction in transmission (by 74.3% and 91.3% compared to pre-treatment level after first and second MDA, respectively). However, the decrease in infection and infectivity rates subsequently also levelled off, and low-level transmission was still noted after the third MDA. The MDAs had limited effect on circulating filarial antigens and antibody response to Bm14.    Conclusion/Significance: Critical issues that may potentially explain the observed waning effect of the MDAs in the later study period include the long intervals between MDAs and a lower than optimal treatment coverage. The findings highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance for monitoring the progress of LF control programmes, and it calls for more research into the long-term effect of repeated ivermectin/albendazole MDAs (including the significance of treatment intervals and compliance), in order to optimize efforts to control LF in sub-Saharan Africa."

For intestinal schistosomiasis, a commercially available urine-dipstick which detects schistosome circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in host urine is being increasingly applied, however, further validation is needed. In this study, we compared the CCA urine-dipstick test against double thick Kato-Katz faecal smears from 171 schoolchildren examined along the Tanzanian and Kenyan shorelines of Lake Victoria. Diagnostic methods were in broad agreement; the mean prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis inferred by Kato-Katz examination was 68.6% (95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 60.7-75.7%) and 71.3% (95% CIs = 63.9-78.8%) by CCA urine-dipsticks. There were, however, difficulties in precisely 'calling' the CCA test result, particularly in discrimination of 'trace' reactions as either putative infection positive or putative infection negative, which has important bearing upon estimation of mean infection prevalence; considering 'trace' as infection positive mean prevalence was 94.2% (95% CIs = 89.5-97.2%). A positive association between increasing intensity of the CCA urine-dipstick test band and faecal egg count was observed. Assigning trace reactions as putative infection negative, overall diagnostic sensitivity (SS) of the CCA urine-dipstick was 87.7% (95% CIs = 80.6-93.0%), specificity (SP) was 68.1% (95% CIs = 54.3-80.0%), positive predictive value (PPV) was 86.1% (95% CIs = 78.8-91.7%) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 71.1% (95% CIs = 57.2-82.8%). To assist in objective defining of the CCA urine-dipstick result, we propose the use of a simple colour chart and conclude that the CCA urine-dipstick is a satisfactory alternative, or supplement, to Kato-Katz examination for rapid detection of intestinal schistosomiasis."

After 20 washes the two products showed no difference in feeding rate (10% with 3.0 and 9% with 2.0) but showed small differences in mortality (95% with 3.0 and 87% with 2.0). Against pyrethroid resistant Culex quinquefasciatus, mediated by elevated oxidase and kdr mechanisms, the unwashed PermaNet 3.0 killed 48% and PermaNet 2.0 killed 32% but after 20 washes there was no significant difference in mortality between the two products (32% killed by 3.0 and 30% by 2.0). For protecting against Culex PermaNet 3.0 showed no difference to PermaNet 2.0 when either unwashed or after 20 washes; both products were highly protective against biting. Laboratory tunnel bioassays confirmed the loss of biological activity of the PBO/deltamethrin-treated panel after washing.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 1573 women aged 16-54 y working in traditional and modern bars, restaurants, hotels, guesthouses or as local food-handlers were enrolled at community-based reproductive health clinics, provided specimens for HIV/STI and pregnancy testing, and asked to attend three-monthly clinical follow-up visits for 12-months. HIV positive and negative women were eligible to enter the feasibility study and to receive free reproductive health services at any time. HIV prevalence at baseline was 26.5% (417/1573). HIV incidence among 1156 sero-negative women attending at baseline was 2.9/100PYs. Among 1020 HIV sero-negative, non-pregnant women, HIV incidence was 2.0/100PYs, HSV-2 incidence 12.7/100PYs and pregnancy rate 17.8/100PYs. Retention at three-months was 76.3% (778/1020). Among 771 HIV sero-negative, non-pregnant women attending at three-months, subsequent follow-up at 6, 9 and 12-months was 83.7%, 79.6%, and 72.1% respectively.

A key concern in bioethics is the validity of informed consent for trial participation obtained from research subjects in such settings. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a continuous informed consent process adopted during the MDP301 phase III vaginal microbicide trial in Mwanza, Tanzania. A total of 1146 women at increased risk of HIV acquisition working as alcohol and food vendors or in bars, restaurants, hotels and guesthouses have been recruited into the MDP301 phase III efficacy and safety trial in Mwanza. During preparations for the trial, participatory community research methods were used to develop a locally-appropriate pictorial flipchart in order to convey key messages about the trial to potential participants. Pre-recorded audio tapes were also developed to facilitate understanding and compliance with gel-use instructions. A comprehension checklist is administered by clinical staff to all participants at screening, enrolment, 12, 24, 40 and 50 week follow-up visits during the trial. To investigate women's perceptions and experiences of the trial, including how well participants internalize and retain key messages provided through a continuous informed consent process, a random sub-sample of 102 women were invited to participate in in-depth interviews (IDIs) conducted immediately after their 4, 24 and 52 week follow-up visits. 99 women completed interviews at 4-weeks, 83 at 24-weeks, and 74 at 52 weeks (a total of 256 interviews). In all interviews there was evidence of good comprehension and retention of key trial messages including that the gel is not currently know to be effective against HIV; that this is the key reason for conducting the trial; and that women should stop using gel in the event of pregnancy. Providing information to trial participants in a focussed, locally-appropriate manner, using methods developed in consultation with the community, and within a continuous informed-consent framework resulted in high levels of comprehension and message retention in this setting.

The assumption has been that parents in African families do not talk about sexual and reproductive health (SRH) with their children. These approach has had limited success because of failure to factor in the young person's family context, and the influence of parents. This paper explores parent-child communication about SRH in families, content, timing and reasons for their communication with their children aged 14-24 years in rural Tanzania. This study employed an ethnographic research design. Data collection involved eight weeks of participant observation, 17 focus group discussions and 46 in-depth interviews conducted with young people aged 14-24 years and parents of young people in this age group. Thematic analysis was conducted with the aid of NVIVO 7 software. Parent-child communication about SRH happened in most families. The communication was mainly on same sex basis (mother-daughter and rarely father-son or father-daughter) and took the form of warnings, threats and physical discipline. Communication was triggered by seeing or hearing something a parent perceived negative and would not like their child to experience (such as a death attributable to HIV and unmarried young person's pregnancy). Although most young people were relaxed with their mothers than fathers, there is lack of trust as to what they can tell their parents for fear of punishment. Parents were limited as to what they could communicate about SRH because of lack of appropriate knowledge and cultural norms that restricted interactions between opposite sex. Due to the consequences of the HIV pandemic, parents are making attempts to communicate with their children about SRH. They are however, limited by cultural barriers, and lack of appropriate knowledge. With some skills training on communication and SRH, parents may be a natural avenue for channeling and reinforcing HIV/AIDS prevention messages to their children.

The aim of this paper is to examine young women's motivations to exchange sex for gifts or money, the way in which they negotiate transactional sex throughout their relationships, and the implications of these negotiations for the HIV epidemic.                                                                                                                       METHOD: An ethnographic research design was used, with information collected primarily using participant observation and in-depth interviews in a rural community in North Western Tanzania. The qualitative approach was complemented by an innovative assisted self-completion questionnaire.    FINDINGS: Transactional sex underlay most non-marital relationships and was not, per se, perceived as immoral. However, women's motivations varied, for instance: escaping intense poverty, seeking beauty products or accumulating business capital. There was also strong pressure from peers to engage in transactional sex, in particular to consume like others and avoid ridicule for inadequate remuneration.Macro-level factors shaping transactional sex (e.g. economic, kinship and normative factors) overwhelmingly benefited men, but at a micro-level there were different dimensions of power, stemming from individual attributes and immediate circumstances, some of which benefited women. Young women actively used their sexuality as an economic resource, often entering into relationships primarily for economic gain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              CONCLUSION: Transactional sex is likely to increase the risk of HIV by providing a dynamic for partner change, making more affluent, higher risk men more desirable, and creating further barriers to condom use. Behavioural interventions should directly address how embedded transactional sex is in sexual culture."

We analyzed specimens from three separate phase III trials of acyclovir (ACV) for prevention of HIV-1 acquisition and transmission to determine if failure of ACV to interrupt HIV acquisition and transmission was associated with genotypic ACV resistance. Acyclovir (400 mg twice daily) or placebo was provided to HSV-2-infected persons at risk of HIV-1 infection in the Mwanza and HPTN 039 trials and to persons dually infected with HSV-2 and HIV-1 who had an HIV-negative partner in the Partners in Prevention study. We extracted HSV DNA from genital ulcer swabs or cervicovaginal lavage fluids from 68 samples obtained from 64 participants randomized to ACV and sequenced the HSV-2 UL23 gene encoding thymidine kinase. The UL23 sequences were compared with published and unpublished data. Variants were observed in 38/1,128 (3.4%) nucleotide positions in the UL23 open reading frame, with 58% of these encoding amino acid changes. No deletions, insertions, or mutations known to be associated with resistance were detected. Thirty-one of the variants (81.5%) are newly reported, 15 of which code for amino acid changes. Overall, UL23 is highly polymorphic compared to other loci in HSV-2, but no drug resistance mutations were detected that could explain the failure to reduce HIV incidence or to prevent HIV-1 transmission in these studies."

Sensitivity was higher in HIV-negative (75/93) than in HIV-positive (44/68) patients (81% vs. 65%, p = 0.02) and increased with CD4 cell count in HIV-positive patients (test for trend p = 0.03). 23 patients (14%) had an indeterminate result and this proportion decreased with increasing CD4 cell count in HIV-positive patients (test for trend p = 0.03). Low CD4 cell count (<300 cells/microl) did not account for all QFT-IT indeterminate nor all negative results. Sensitivity when excluding indeterminate results was 86% (95% CI: 81-92%) and did not differ between HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients (88 vs. 83%, p = 0.39).                                                                                                                CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Sensitivity of the QFT-IT for diagnosing active PTB infection was reasonable when excluding indeterminate results and in HIV-negative patients. However, since the test missed more than 10% of patients, its potential as a rule-out test for active TB disease is limited. Furthermore, test performance is impaired by low CD4 cell count in HIV-positive patients and possibly by other factors as well in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. This might limit the potential of the test in populations where HIV-infection is prevalent."

Tanzania has been a leader in social marketing but it is still not clear if this can result in high and equitable levels of coverage. A cluster-randomized survey of ITN and bed net ownership and use was conducted in a rural area exposed to intense Plasmodium falciparum transmission in NE Tanzania where ITN distribution had been subject to routine delivery of national strategies and episodic free distribution through local clinics. Data were collected on household assets to assess equity of ITN coverage and a rapid diagnostic test for malaria (RDT) was performed in all ages. Among 598 households in four villages the use of any or insecticidal bed nets in children less than five years of age was 71% and 54% respectively. However there was a 19.8% increase in the number of bed nets per person (p < 0.001) and a 13.4% increase in the number of insecticidal nets per person (p < 0.001) for each quintile increase in household asset score. The odds of being RDT-positive were reduced by more than half in the least poor compared to the poorest households (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.35–0.70). Poorer households had paid less for their nets and acquired them more recently, particularly from non-commercial sources, and bed nets in the least poor households were less likely to be insecticidal compared to nets in the poorest households (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26–0.74). Marked inequity persists with the poorest households still experiencing the highest risk of malaria and the lowest ITN coverage. Abolition of this inequity within the foreseeable future is likely to require mass or targeted free distribution, but risks damaging what is otherwise an effective commercial market. "

To date most priority setting initiatives in health systems have mainly focused on technical approaches involving information derived from burden of disease statistics, cost effectiveness analysis, and published clinical trials. However, priority setting involves value-laden choices and these technical approaches do not equip decision-makers to address a broader range of relevant values - such as trust, equity, accountability and fairness - that are of concern to other partners and, not least, the populations concerned. A new focus for priority setting is needed.Accountability for Reasonableness (AFR) is an explicit ethical framework for legitimate and fair priority setting that provides guidance for decision-makers who must identify and consider the full range of relevant values. AFR consists of four conditions: i) relevance to the local setting, decided by agreed criteria; ii) publicizing priority-setting decisions and the reasons behind them; iii) the establishment of revisions/appeal mechanisms for challenging and revising decisions; iv) the provision of leadership to ensure that the first three conditions are met.REACT - ""REsponse to ACcountable priority setting for Trust in health systems"" is an EU-funded five-year intervention study started in 2006, which is testing the application and effects of the AFR approach in one district each in Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia. The objectives of REACT are to describe and evaluate district-level priority setting, to develop and implement improvement strategies guided by AFR and to measure their effect on quality, equity and trust indicators. Effects are monitored within selected disease and programme interventions and services and within human resources and health systems management. Qualitative and quantitative methods are being applied in an action research framework to examine the potential of AFR to support sustainable improvements to health systems performance.This paper reports on the project design and progress and argues that there is a high need for research into legitimate and fair priority setting to improve the knowledge base for achieving sustainable improvements in health outcomes."

The binding is mediated by members of Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family. PfEMP1s can be divided into groups, and it has previously been suggested that parasites expressing group A or B/A PfEMP1s are most pathogenic. To test the hypothesis that the first malaria infections in infants and young children are dominated by parasites expressing A and B/A PfEMP1s, we measured the plasma Ab level against 48 recombinant PfEMP1 domains of different groupings in 1342 individuals living in five African villages characterized by markedly different malaria transmission. We show that children progressively acquire a broader repertoire of anti-PfEMP1 Abs, but that the rate of expansion is governed by transmission intensity. However, independently of transmission intensity, Abs are first acquired to particular duffy binding ligand-like domains belonging to group A or B/A PfEMP1s. The results support the view that anti-PfEMP1 Ab responses effectively structure the expenditure of the repertoire of PfEMP1 maintained by the parasite. Parasites expressing certain group A and B/A PfEMP1s are responded to first by individuals with limited previous exposure, and the resulting Abs reduce the fitness and pathogenicity of these parasites during subsequent infections. This allows parasites expressing less pathogenic PFEMP1s to dominate during later infections. The identification of PfEMP1 domains expressed by parasites causing disease in infants and young children is important for development of vaccines protecting against severe malaria."

Tanzania, one of the 22 high-burden countries regarding TB, changed the first-line treatment regimen to contain rifampicin-containing fixed-dose combination for the full 6 months of treatment. As daily health facility-based DOT for this long period is not feasible for the patient, nor for the health system, Tanzania introduced patient centred treatment (PCT). PCT allows patients to choose for daily DOT at a health facility or at their home by a supporter of choice. The introduction of fixed dose combinations in the intensive and continuation phase made PCT feasible by eliminating the risk of selective drug taking by patients and reducing the number of tablets to be taken. The approach was tested in three districts with the objective to assess the effect of this strategy on TB treatment outcomes      Methods: Cohort analysis comparing patients treated under the PCT strategy (registered April-September 2006) with patients treated under health-facility-based DOT (registered April-September 2005). The primary outcome was the cure rate. Differences were assessed by calculating the risk ratios. Associations between characteristics of the supporters and treatment outcomes in the group of patients opting for home-based DOT were assessed through logistic regression.                                                                                         Results: In the PCT cohort there were 1208 patients and 1417 were included in the historic cohort. There was no significant difference in cure rates between the cohorts (risk ratio [RR]: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-1.16). In the PCT cohort, significantly more patients had successful treatment (cure or treatment completed; RR: 1.10; 95%CI: 1.01-1.15). There were no characteristics of supporters that were associated with treatment outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                     Conclusion: The PCT approach showed similar cure rates and better treatment success rates compared to daily health-facility DOT. The results indicate that there are no specific prerequisites for the supporter chosen by the patient. The programmatic setting of the study lends strong support for scaling-up of TB treatment observation outside the health facility."

PTB+ and HIV infection, alcohol drinking and smoking were the positive predictors of serum ferritin, and female sex, soil eating, Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm infection were the negative predictors. Similarly, smoking and HIV infection were the negative predictors of serum sTfR, and female sex, soil eating and PTB+ were the positive predictors. Serum ferritin and serum sTfR are affected by the APR, but may still provide information about Fe status. It may be possible to develop algorithms, based on the markers of the APR and Fe status, to assess the Fe status among the patients with tuberculosis or other infections eliciting an APR."

Enrolment was stopped early (87 in the symptomatic and 25 in the asymptomatic studies) due to the high failure rate. Molecular markers were examined for recrudescence, re-infection and markers of drug resistance and a review of literature of studies looking for the 581G dhps mutation was carried out. In symptomatic children PCR-corrected early treatment failure was 38.8% (95% CI 26.8–50.8) and total failures by day 28 were 82.2% (95% CI 72.5–92.0). There was no significant difference in treatment failures between asymptomatic and symptomatic children. 96% of samples carried parasites with mutations at codons 51, 59 and 108 in the dhfr gene and 63% carried a double mutation at codons 437 and 540. 55% carried a third mutation with the addition of a mutation at codon 581 in the dhps gene.

Conclusion: In northern Tanzania SP is a failed drug for treatment and its utility for prophylaxis is doubtful. The study found a new combination of parasite mutations that maybe associated with increased and earlier failure."

Lancet 373, 557-566.", Pre-referral rectal artesunate to prevent death and disability in severe malaria: a placebo-controlled tiral,Malaria, Lancet,2009,373,,557,566,25,,,,,,,,,"BACKGROUND: Most malaria deaths occur in rural areas. Rapid progression from illness to death can be interrupted by prompt, effective medication. Antimalarial treatment cannot rescue terminally ill patients but could be effective if given earlier. If patients who cannot be treated orally are several hours from facilities for injections, rectal artesunate can be given before referral and acts rapidly on parasites. We investigated whether this intervention reduced mortality and permanent disability.                                                                                 METHODS: In Bangladesh, Ghana, and Tanzania, patients with suspected severe malaria who could not be treated orally were allocated randomly to a single artesunate (n=8954) or placebo (n=8872) suppository by taking the next numbered box, then referred to clinics at which injections could be given. Those with antimalarial injections or negative blood smears before randomisation were excluded, leaving 12 068 patients (6072 artesunate, 5996 placebo) for analysis. Primary endpoints were mortality, assessed 7-30 days later, and permanent disability, reassessed periodically. All investigators were masked to group assignment. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered in all three countries, numbers ISRCTN83979018, 46343627, and 76987662.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        RESULTS: Mortality was 154 of 6072 artesunate versus 177 of 5996 placebo (2.5%vs 3.0%, p=0.1). Two versus 13 (0.03%vs 0.22%, p=0.0020) were permanently disabled; total dead or disabled: 156 versus 190 (2.6%vs 3.2%, p=0.0484). There was no reduction in early mortality (56 vs 51 deaths within 6 h; median 2 h). In patients reaching clinic within 6 h (median 3 h), pre-referral artesunate had no significant effect on death after 6 h or permanent disability (71/4450 [1.6%] vs 82/4426 [1.9%], risk ratio 0.86 [95% CI 0.63-1.18], p=0.35). In patients still not in clinic after more than 6 h, however, half were still not there after more than 15 h, and pre-referral rectal artesunate significantly reduced death or permanent disability (29/1566 [1.9%] vs 57/1519 [3.8%], risk ratio 0.49 [95% CI 0.32-0.77], p=0.0013).                                                                                                                                                                                               INTERPRETATION: If patients with severe malaria cannot be treated orally and access to injections will take several hours, a single inexpensive artesunate suppository at the time of referral substantially reduces the risk of death or permanent disability.

However, rising resistance to this combination is a concern. We investigated a shortacting and longacting antimalarial drug as alternative regimens for IPTi.                                            METHODS: We undertook a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of IPTi in an area of high resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine at sites of moderate (n=1280 infants enrolled) and low (n=1139) intensity of malaria transmission in Tanzania. Infants aged 8-16 weeks were randomly assigned in blocks of 16 to sulfadoxine (250 mg) plus pyrimethamine (12.5 mg; n=319 in moderate-transmission and 283 in low-transmission sites), chlorproguanil (15 mg) plus dapsone (18.75 mg; n=317 and 285), mefloquine (125 mg; n=320 and 284), or placebo (n=320 and 284), given at the second and third immunisations for diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, and for measles. Research team and child were masked to treatment. Recruitment was stopped early at the low-transmission site because of low malaria incidence. The primary endpoint was protective efficacy against all episodes of clinical malaria at 2-11 months of age. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00158574.                                                                                                                          FINDINGS: All randomly assigned infants were analysed. At the moderate-transmission site, mefloquine had a protective efficacy of 38.1% (95% CI 11.8-56.5, p=0.008) against clinical malaria in infants aged 2-11 months, but neither sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (-6.7%, -45.9 to 22.0) nor chlorproguanil-dapsone (10.8%, -24.6 to 36.1) had a protective effect. No regimen had any protective efficacy against anaemia or hospital admission. Mefloquine caused vomiting in 141 of 1731 (8%) doses given on day 1 (odds ratio vs placebo 5.50, 95% CI 3.56-8.46). More infants died in the chlorproguanil-dapsone and mefloquine groups (18 and 15, respectively) than in the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or placebo groups (eight deaths per group; p=0.05 for difference between chlorproguanil-dapsone and placebo).                                                                                                                                                                                          INTERPRETATION: IPTi with a longacting, efficacious drug such as mefloquine can reduce episodes of malaria in infants in a moderate-transmission setting. IPTi with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine has no benefit in areas of very high resistance to this combination. The appropriateness of IPTi should be measured by the expected incidence of malaria and the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the drug.

Malaria Journal 8:191 ",Community response to intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants (IPTi) delivered through the expanded programme of immunization in five African settings,IPTi,Malaria Journal ,2009,8,,191,,16,,,,,,,,,"IPTi delivered through EPI has been shown to reduce the incidence of clinical malaria by 20–59%. However, new health interventions can only be effective if they are also socially and culturally acceptable. It is also crucial to ensure that attitudes to IPTi do not negatively influence attitudes to and uptake of immunization, or that people do not misunderstand IPTi as immunization against malaria and neglect other preventive measures or delay treatment seeking. These issues were studied in five African countries in the context of clinical trials and implementation studies of IPTi. Mixed methods were used, including structured questionnaires (1,296), semi-structured interviews (168), in-depth interviews (748) and focus group discussions (95) with mothers, fathers, health workers, community members, opinion leaders, and traditional healers. Participant observation was also carried out in the clinics. IPTi was widely acceptable because it resonated with existing traditional preventive practices and a general concern about infant health and good motherhood. It also fit neatly within already widely accepted routine vaccination. Acceptance and adherence were further facilitated by the hierarchical relationship between health staff and mothers and by the fact that clinic attendance had a social function for women beyond acquiring health care. Type of drug and regimen were important, with newer drugs being seen as more effective, but potentially also more dangerous. Single dose infant formulations delivered in the clinic seem to be the most likely to be both acceptable and adhered to. There was little evidence that IPTi per se had a negative impact on attitudes to EPI or that it had any affect on EPI adherence. There was also little evidence of IPTi having a negative impact on health seeking for infants with febrile illness or existing preventive practices. IPTi is generally acceptable across a wide range of settings in Africa and involving different drugs and regimens, though there is a strong preference for a single dose infant formulation. IPTi does not appear to have any negative effect on attitudes to EPI, and it is not interpreted as immunization against malaria."

However, parasites resistant to the IPTp drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) have emerged worldwide, and infections with mixed resistant and susceptible parasites are exacerbated by pyrimethamine in mice. In a prospective delivery cohort in Muheza, Tanzania, we examined the effects of SP IPTp on parasite resistance alleles, parasite diversity, level of parasitemia, and inflammation in the placenta. IPTp use was associated with an increased fraction of parasites carrying the resistance allele at DHPS codon 581, an increase in the level of parasitemia, and more intense placental inflammation. The lowest mean level of parasite diversity and highest mean level of parasitemia occurred in women after recent IPTp use. These findings support a model of parasite release and facilitation, whereby the most highly resistant parasites out-compete less fit parasite populations and overgrow under drug pressure. Use of partially effective anti-malarial agents for IPTp may exacerbate malaria infections in the setting of widespread drug resistance."

The availability and quality of diagnostic services in 37 health laboratories in three districts of the Tanga region of Tanzania have recently been assessed. The results of the survey, which involved interviews with health workers, observations and a documentary review, revealed that malaria accounted for >50% of admissions and out-patient visits. Most (92%) of the laboratories were carrying out malaria diagnosis and 89% were measuring haemoglobin concentrations but only one (3%) was conducting culture and sensitivity tests, and those only on urine and pus samples. Only 14 (17%) of the 84 people found working in the visited laboratories were laboratory technologists with a diploma certificate or higher qualification. Sixteen (43%) of the study laboratories each had five or fewer types of equipment and only seven (19%) had more than 11 types each. Although 11 (30%) of the laboratories reported that they conducted internal quality control, none had standard operating procedures (SOP) on display or evidence of such quality assurance. Although malaria was the main health problem, diagnostic services for malaria and other diseases were inadequate and of poor quality because of the limited human resources, poor equipment and shortage of supplies. If the health services in Tanga are not to be overwhelmed by the progressively increasing burden of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other emerging and re-emerging diseases, more funding and appropriate policies to improve the availability and quality of the area's diagnostic services will clearly be required."

The initial GWA scan included 2,500 children genotyped on the Affymetrix 500K GeneChip, and a replication study included 3,400 children. We used this to examine the performance of GWA methods in Africa. We found considerable population stratification, and also that signals of association at known malaria resistance loci were greatly attenuated owing to weak linkage disequilibrium (LD). To investigate possible solutions to the problem of low LD, we focused on the HbS locus, sequencing this region of the genome in 62 Gambian individuals and then using these data to conduct multipoint imputation in the GWA samples. This increased the signal of association, from P = 4 × 10(-7) to P = 4 × 10(-14), with the peak of the signal located precisely at the HbS causal variant. Our findings provide proof of principle that fine-resolution multipoint imputation, based on population-specific sequencing data, can substantially boost authentic GWA signals and enable fine mapping of causal variants in African populations."

DBS specimens were stored at tropical room temperature for 3 weeks before testing with the NucliSENS EasyQ HIV-1 v1.2 assay. Results obtained with DBS were compared with results obtained with use of a gold-standard plasma assay.                                                                                                                                                                                                        RESULTS:Ninety-eight plasma-DBS pairs were compared, and plasma viral loads ranged from <40 to >1,000,000 copies/mL. The correlation between plasma and DBS viral load was strong (R(2) = 0.75). The mean difference (+/- standard deviation) was 0.04 +/ 0.57 log(10) copies/mL, and only 8 samples showed >1 log(10) copies/mL difference. HIV type 1 RNA was detected in 7%, 60%, and 100% of DBS specimens with corresponding plasma viral loads of 40-999, 1000-2999, and 3000 copies/mL, respectively.                                                                 CONCLUSIONS:DBS, in combination with the NucliSENS EasyQ HIV-1 v1.2 asay, performed well in monitoring HIV viral loads in patients who received ART in rural Tanzania, although the sensitivity was reduced when viral burden was low. The use of DBS can simplify virological monitoring in resource-limited settings."

We examined virological efficacy and emergence of drug resistance in adults receiving first-line ART for up to 4 years in rural Tanzania. Methods: Haydom Lutheran Hospital has provided ART to HIV-infected patients since October 2003. A combination of stavudine or zidovudine with lamivudine and either nevirapine or efavirenz is the standard first-line regimen. Nested in a longitudinal cohort study of patients consecutively starting ART, we carried out a cross-sectional virological efficacy survey between November 2007 and June 2008. HIV viral load was measured in all adults who had completed at least 6 months first-line ART, and genotypic resistance was determined in patients with viral load >1000 copies/mL. Results: Virological response was measured in 212 patients, of whom 158 (74.5%) were women, and median age was 35 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29–43). Median follow-up time was 22.3 months (IQR 14.0–29.9). Virological suppression, defined as <400 copies/mL, was observed in 187 patients (88.2%). Overall, prevalence of ³1 clinically significant resistance mutation was 3.9, 8.4, 16.7 and 12.5% in patients receiving ART for 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively. Among those successfully genotyped, the most frequent mutations were M184I/V (64%), conferring resistance to lamivudine, and K103N (27%), Y181C (27%) and G190A (27%), conferring resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), whereas 23% had thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs), associated with crossresistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Dual-class resistance, i.e. resistance to both NRTIs and NNRTIs, was found in 64%. Conclusion: Virological suppression rates were good up to 4 years after initiating ART in a rural Tanzanian hospital. However, drug resistance increased with time, and dual-class resistance was common, raising concerns about exhaustion of future antiretroviral drug options. This study might provide a useful forecast of drug resistance and demand for second-line antiretroviral drugs in rural Africa in the coming years."

However, there is scarce information on the pattern of malaria related mortality in epidemic prone districts of Tanzania. This study was carried out to determine malaria related mortality and establish its trend change over time in both epidemic and non-epidemic areas of Muleba District of north-western Tanzania. A verbal autopsy survey was conducted to obtain data on all deaths of individuals who died in six randomly selected villages from 1997 to 2006. Relatives of the deceased were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire. Communicable diseases accounted for about two thirds (61.9%) of deaths among > or =5 years individuals and 84.8% in < or =5 years. Non-communicable diseases accounted for 28.9% and 14.1% deaths in > or =5 years and < or =5 years, respectively. Malaria was the leading cause of deaths in all age groups (40.3%) and among children <5 years (73.8%). Infants accounted for about two third (64.5%) of all malaria related deaths in children <5 years. Peak of malaria proportional mortality was highest during malaria epidemics. Most of the malaria-related deaths in this group were among 1-12 months (64.5%) followed by 13-24 months (20.9%), and 25-59 months (14.8%). Cerebral malaria accounted for 18.9% (N=32) of death related to malaria in all age groups; 12.1% (17/141) were in under-five, 42.9% (6/14) were in 5-14 years and 64.3% (9/14) in 15-70 years old. More than half of malaria related deaths (61.0%) in <5 years children were associated with severe anaemia followed by diarrhoeal disease (24.1%), cerebral malaria (12.5%) and respiratory infection (8.5%) as common conditions. The majority of the deceased caretakers first sought treatment at health facilities within 24hr of the onset of illness. Significantly a higher proportion of caretakers of the underfives in the epidemic area sought treatment within 24hr than in non-epidemic area (39.3% vs. 18.5%; P = 0.0385). In conclusion, malaria accounts for majority of deaths in Muleba district, with substantial proportion being attributed to malaria epidemics."

The questionnaires asked about reproductive and contraceptive history and intentions, and sexual behaviour. Subject to participants' consent, we collected blood to determine HIV status and linked these results to the questionnaire data through individual numbers. HIV prevalence was 8.9% overall, and family planning ever use was 26%. HIV-positive and HIV-negative women differed with respect to age, parity, length of last birth interval, child survival, childbearing intentions and intention to breastfeed. HIV-positive women were more likely to have used family planning, particularly hormonal methods. Patterns of family planning use and unmet need for contraception yielded useful information for the design of family planning counselling services at antenatal clinics. Our survey findings point to numerous potential benefits of offering family planning counselling as a part of antenatal services, particularly in clinics offering HIV testing. The differences in reproductive history and intentions between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women highlight the necessity of tailoring family planning counselling to their specific needs."

METHODS: The crude extracts from the leaves, stem and root barks of the investigated plants were obtained by solvent extraction and then bio-assayed following WHO protocols showed LC50 values 10 to 400 ppm after 24 h exposure. The structures were determined on interpretation of spectroscopic data.                                                                                                           RESULTS: The most active extracts were those from the stem and root barks of Annona squamosa, Uvaria faulknerae, U. kirkii and Uvariodendron pycnophyllum, all of which had LC50 values between 10 and 100 ppm. Long-term exposure beyond 24 h also showed more susceptibility of the larvae to the extracts. Larvae deformities by forming tail-like structures were observed for the methanol extracts of Tessmannia martiniana var pauloi.

There is a pressing need for development and use of alternative control approaches, which will remain effective even with increasing threat of mosquito resistance to chemical control and smaller number of approved chemical insecticides. This study evaluated the effect of combined use of attractant baited Mosquito Magnet Liberty Plus™ (MM) trap and bed nets on human mosquito biting rates under semi-field conditions. Human landing catch done under holed bednets was used to assess the number of biting mosquitoes attracted to human bait. A combination of MM trap and untreated bednet reduced biting rates of Culex quinquefasciatus but not Anopheles gambiae s.s. However, combining an insecticide treated bednet (ITN) and MM trap greatly reduced biting rates of both Cx quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae s.s. Moreover, a treated bednet increased the MM trap catch of both Cx quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae s.s. The present study has shown the potential of a combination of MM trap and ITN in trapping and controlling vectors of malaria and lymphatic filariasis. Synergistic use of attractant baited traps and ITNs displays a ‘push-pull’ phenomenon. The findings indicate that the strategy could be incorporated in an integrated mosquito control approach to maximise the efficiency of mosquito populationreduction methods through the use of appropriately selected methods.

The creation of strong networks of excellence for clinical research among southern academic and research institutions is a novel strategic approach championed by European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership to achieve the aforementioned goals and mitigate the high disease burden. It will promote strong collaboration, resource sharing and cross-mentorship allowing each partner to grow with complementary capacities that support each other rather than compete negatively.

Several studies have focused on determining the distribution and abundance of bedbug populations in tropical areas. This study establishes baseline information on deltamethrin, permethrin, alphacypermethrin, lambdacypermethrin and K-O tab susceptibility status in a bedbug population collected from Magugu area in northern Tanzania. The evolution of insecticide resistance could be a primary factor in explaining this resurgence of bedbugs in many areas, both rural and urban. Evaluation of the bedbug population from houses in Magugu indicates that the population of bedbugs is susceptible to pyrethroid insecticides, which are commonly used. Without the development of new tactics for bedbug resistance management, further escalation of this public health problem should be expected when resistant gene spreads within the population. These results suggest that although all concentrations kill bedbugs, more evaluations should be done using WHO kits and mechanisms involved in pyrethroid resistance should be evaluated, such as metabolic and knockdown resistance gene, to have a broad picture for better design of control methodologies."

A blood stage malaria vaccine candidate, Merozoite Surface Protein-3 (MSP3), produced as a long synthetic peptide, has been shown to be safe in non-immune and semi-immune adults. A phase Ib dose-escalating study was conducted to assess the vaccine's safety and immunogenicity in children aged 12 to 24 months in Korogwe, Tanzania (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT00469651).                                                             Methods: This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled, dose escalation phase Ib trial, in which children were given one of two different doses of the MSP3 antigen (15 ?g or 30 ?g) or a control vaccine (Engerix B). Children were randomly allocated either to the MSP3 candidate malaria vaccine or the control vaccine administered at a schedule of 0, 1, and 2 months. Immunization with lower and higher doses was staggered for safety reasons starting with the lower dose. The primary endpoint was safety and reactogenicity within 28 days post-vaccination. Blood samples were obtained at different time points to measure immunological responses. Results are presented up to 84 days post-vaccination.                                    Results: A total of 45 children were enrolled, 15 in each of the two MSP3 dose groups and 15 in the Engerix B group. There were no important differences in reactogenicity between the two MSP3 groups and Engerix B. Grade 3 adverse events were infrequent; only five were detected throughout the study, all of which were transient and resolved without sequelae. No serious adverse event reported was considered to be related to MSP3 vaccine. Both MSP3 dose regimens elicited strong cytophilic IgG responses (subclasses IgG1 and IgG3), the isotypes involved in the monocyte-dependant mechanism of Plasmodium falciparum parasite-killing. The titers reached are similar to those from African adults having reached a state of premunition. Furthermore, vaccination induced seroconversion in all vaccinees.                                                                                                                                                                                               Conclusion: The MSP3 malaria vaccine candidate was safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in children aged 12–24 months living in a malaria endemic community.

The other effects of the disease range from severe, acute but short-term bouts of sickness to psychological impairment, poverty and family hardship. It is important to support cases of the disease through all means available, such as reparative hydrocelectomy, hygiene training and facilitation, and the provision of adequate chemotherapy. Although only a minority of the residents in any endemic community is affected with the severe clinical manifestations of this parasitic infection, these cases are central to, and important advocates for, the current global effort to eliminate the infection through mass drug administrations (MDA). Their clinical improvement acts as an important catalyst for the general population and encourages high compliance in the MDA.

Their behavioural effects and efficacy were examined in Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) and Anopheles funestus Giles s.s. in Muheza, Tanzania, and in Anopheles arabiensis Patton and Culex quinquefasciatus Say in Moshi, Tanzania. A standardized dosage of 25 mg/m(2) plus high dosages of carbosulfan (50 mg/m(2), 100 mg/m(2) and 200 mg/m(2)) and chlorpyrifos-methyl (100 mg/m(2)) were used to compare the three types of insecticide. At 25 mg/m(2), the rank order of the insecticides for insecticide-induced mortality in wild An. gambiae and An. funestus was, respectively, carbosulfan (88%, 86%) > deltamethrin (79%, 78%) > chlorpyrifos-methyl (35%, 53%). The rank order of the insecticides for blood-feeding inhibition (reduction in the number of blood-fed mosquitoes compared with control) in wild An. gambiae and An. funestus was deltamethrin > chlorpyrifos-methyl > carbosulfan. Carbosulfan was particularly toxic to endophilic anophelines at 200 mg/m(2), killing 100% of An. gambiae and 98% of An. funestus that entered the huts. It was less effective against the more exophilic An. arabiensis (67% mortality) and carbamate-resistant Cx quinquefasciatus (36% mortality). Carbosulfan deterred anophelines from entering huts, but did not deter carbamate-resistant Cx quinquefasciatus. Deltamethrin reduced the proportion of insects engaged in blood-feeding, probably as a consequence of contact irritancy, whereas carbosulfan seemed to provide personal protection through deterred entry or perhaps a spatial repellent action. Any deployment of carbosulfan as an individual treatment on nets should be carried out on a large scale to reduce the risk of diverting mosquitoes to unprotected individuals. Chlorpyrifos-methyl was inferior to deltamethrin in terms of mortality and blood-feeding inhibition and would be better deployed on a net in combination with a pyrethroid to control insecticide-resistant mosquitoes."

So far there is scant information as to the psychosocial impacts of dental diseases and the perceived treatment need in child populations of sub-Saharan Africa.    Objectives: Focusing on primary school students in Kilwa, Tanzania, a district deprived of dental services and with low fluoride concentration in drinking water, this study aimed to assess the prevalence of dental pain and oral impacts on daily performances (OIDP), and to describe the distribution of OIDP by socio-demographics, dental caries, dental pain and reported oral problems. The relationship of perceived need estimates with OIDP was also investigated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008. A total of 1745 students (mean age 13.8 yr, sd = 1.67) completed an extensive personal interview and under-went clinical examination. The impacts on daily performances were assessed using a Kiswahili version of the Child-OIDP instrument and caries experience was recorded using WHO (1997) criteria Results: A total of 36.2% (41.3% urban and 31.4% rural, p < 0.001) reported at least one OIDP. The prevalence of dental caries was 17.4%, dental pain 36.4%, oral problems 54.1% and perceived need for dental treatment 46.8% in urban students. Corresponding estimates in rural students were 20.8%, 24.4%, 43.3% and 43.8%. Adjusted OR for reporting oral impacts if having dental pain ranged from 2.5 (95% CI 1.8–3.6) (problem smiling) to 4.7 (95% CI 3.4–6.5) (problem sleeping),- if having oral problems, from 1.9 (95% CI 1.3–2.6) (problem sleeping) to 3.8 (95% CI 2.7–5.2) (problem eating) and if having dental caries from 1.5 (95% CI 1.1–2.0) (problem eating) to 2.2 (95% CI 1.5–2.9) (problem sleeping). Students who perceived need for dental care were less likely to be females (OR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.6–0.9) and more likely to have impacts on eating (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.4–2.7) and tooth cleaning (OR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.6–2.5).        Conclusion: Substantial proportions of students suffered from untreated dental caries, oral impacts on daily performances and perceived need for dental care. Dental pain and reported oral problems varied systematically with OIDP across the eight impacts considered. Eating and tooth cleaning problems discriminated between subjects who perceived need for dental treatment and those who did not."

This paper explores beliefs, attitudes and behavioural perspectives on HIV/AIDS education among students in Tanzania as there has been few qualitative information on the subject.                                                                                       METHODS: A total of 20 college students of both sexes were interviewed in a qualitative study. Health Belief Model and Social Cognitive Theory were used to guide the interview and constant comparative analysis on their attitudes, beliefs, behavior and education towards HIV infection risks were utilised.                                                                                                   RESULTS: During the interview, the following topics emerged: misinformation and desire for HIV/AIDS education program in school curricula; perceptions of one's own and peer's susceptibility to HIV infection; social norms regarding sexual behaviour and perceptions regarding access to education and health services. Lack of accurate information and lack of education at home and at school further contributed to risk behavior.

RESULTS: Results showed that voluntary counselling and testing services were limited in the study area at the time of study. Participants complained of unfriendly services and unco-operative staff, poor counselling services and shortage of facilities and staff. There was fear of HIV/AIDS related stigma toward people living with HIV and AIDS, thus fostering stigma and isolation against them. Results further demonstrate that HIV/AIDS related stigma is still a very serious problem in Tanzania. Lack of HIV/AIDS related knowledge and the life-threatening character of the disease were seen as the most important determinants of AIDS-related stigma. The main benefit to go for VCT was 'knowing your status before marriage', whereas main barriers for testing were 'fear of being stigmatised' and 'fear of knowing your HIV positive status'.      CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there is need of VCT specific intervention programs for young people in colleges in Tanzania to emphasize of importance of VCT services and HIV/AIDS education program to educate students' understanding of people living with HIV/AIDS, thus reducing stigma towards people living with HIV/AIDS."

We aimed to determine resistance rates to first line anti tuberculosis drugs and to describe factors associated with the resistance to any of the first line anti tuberculosis drugs in Dar es Salaam Tanzania.                                                  Materials: Newly diagnosed, TB patients with neither history of tuberculosis treatment nor isoniazid prophylaxis were included into the study. Sputum specimens were cultured on either mycobacteria growth indicator tube 960 (MGIT 960) or Lowenstein Jenstein (LJ) medium supplemented with either glycerol (GLJ) or pyruvate (PLJ). Drug susceptibility for isoniazid, rifampicin, streptomycin and ethambutol was determined by either Lowenstein–Jensen (LJ) medium or mycobacteria growth indicator tube 960 (MGIT 960).

A total of 661 adult males and females were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Most respondents (85.6%) were engaged in crop production. Significantly, a larger proportion (55.2%) of the respondents had primary school education (P<0.001). Majority (88.2%) respondents described malaria as the most important public health problem. However, only 48.2% of the respondents had high knowledge of malaria. The level of knowledge on malaria was associated with level of education of the respondent. Those who had attended at least primary school education were more knowledgeable that those without formal education. A significantly larger proportion (67%) of the respondents experienced most malaria episodes during the rainy season (P<0.001). Respondents with low knowledge on malaria experienced 2.3 times more malaria cases in their households than those with higher knowledge. Respondents with low knowledge preferred to seek care from health facilities (OR: 7.28) than those with high knowledge (OR: 0.15). Rice farming was significantly associated with malaria transmission compared to either maize or sugarcane farming (P<0.001). Cattle, sheep and goats were the domestic animals most frequently incriminated to create aquatic habitats for mosquito breeding. Householders with formal education (OR: 4.6, CI: 1.33-15.89, P-value=0.016) and higher knowledge (OR: 1.7, CI: 1.15-2.55, P-value=0.008) reported to incur large losses when having a malaria case than those without education/low knowledge. Majority (60.2%) of the respondent owned at least an insecticide treated mosquito net (ITN). Respondents with higher knowledge of malaria were likely to own at least an ITN than those with low knowledge (P<0.001). In conclusion, the knowledge on malaria and its linkage with agriculture among farming communities in Mvomero District is low. Malaria is a complex health problem and its control approach needs understanding of the environmental factors associated with agricultural practices. It therefore is important that education and communication messages on malaria targeting farming communities take into consideration local agricultural practices."

Studies show that Active Management of Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) reduces Post Partum Hemorrhage (PPH). This study describes the practice of AMTSL and barriers to its effective use in Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                                    Methods: A nationally-representative sample of 251 facility-based vaginal deliveries was observed for the AMTSL practice. Standard Treatment Guidelines (STG), the Essential Drug List and medical and midwifery school curricula were reviewed. Drug availability and storage conditions were reviewed at the central pharmaceutical storage site and pharmacies in the selected facilities. Interviews were conducted with hospital directors, pharmacists and 106 health care providers in 29 hospitals visited. Data were collected between November 10 and December 15, 2005.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Results: Correct practice of AMTSL according to the ICM/FIGO definition was observed in 7% of 251 deliveries. When the definition of AMTSL was relaxed to allow administration of the uterotonic drug within three minutes of fetus delivery, the proportion of AMTSL use increased to 17%. The most significant factor contributing to the low rate of AMTSL use was provision of the uterotonic drug after delivery of the placenta. The study also observed potentially-harmful practices in approximately 1/3 of deliveries. Only 9% out of 106 health care providers made correct statements regarding the all three components of AMTSL. The national formulary recommends ergometrine (0.5 mg/IM) or oxytocin (5 IU/IM) on delivery of the anterior shoulder or immediately after the baby is delivered. Most of facilities had satisfactory stores of drugs and supplies. Uterotonic drugs were stored at room temperature in 28% of the facilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Conclusion: The knowledge and practice of AMTSL is very low and STGs are not updated on correct AMTSL practice. The drugs for AMTSL are available and stored at the right conditions in nearly all facilities. All providers used ergometrine for AMTSL instead of oxytocin as recommended by ICM/FIGO. The study also observed harmful practices during delivery. These findings indicate that there is a need for updating the STGs, curricula and training of health providers on AMTSL and monitoring its practice"

Evaluation of malaria interventions, such as drugs and vaccines depends on clinical definition of the disease, which is still a challenge due to lack of distinct malaria specific clinical features. Parasite threshold is used in definition of clinical malaria in evaluation of interventions. This however, is likely to be influenced by other factors such as transmission intensity as well as individual level of immunity against malaria.               Methods: This paper describes step function and dose response model with threshold parameter as a tool for estimation of parasite threshold for onset of malaria fever in highlands (low transmission) and lowlands (high transmission intensity) strata. These models were fitted using logistic regression stratified by strata and age groups (0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-9, and 10-19 years). Dose response model was further extended to fit all age groups combined in each stratum. Sub-sampling bootstrap was used to compute confidence intervals. Cross-sectional and passive case detection data from Korogwe district, north eastern Tanzania were used.                                                                                                                                                                          Results: Dose response model was better in the estimation of parasite thresholds. Parasite thresholds (scale = log parasite/?L) were high in lowlands than in highlands. In the lowlands, children in age group 4-5 years had the highest parasite threshold (8.73) while individuals aged 10-19 years had the lowest (6.81). In the highlands, children aged 0-1 years had the highest threshold (7.12) and those aged 10-19 years had the lowest (4.62). Regression analysis with all ages combined showed similar pattern of thresholds in both strata, whereby, in the lowlands the threshold was highest in age group 2-5 years and lowest in older individuals, while in the highlands was highest in age group 0-1 and decreased with increased age. The sensitivity of parasite threshold by age group ranged from 64%-74% in the lowlands and 67%-97% in the highlands; while specificity ranged between 67%-90% in the lowlands and 37%-73% in the highlands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Conclusion: Dose response model with threshold parameter can be used to estimate parasite threshold associated with malaria fever onset. Parasite threshold were lower in older individuals and in low malaria transmission area."

This study was conducted in 12 villages to determine malariometric indices and associated risk factors, during long and short rainy seasons, in an area with varying malaria transmission intensities in Korogwe district, Tanzania. Four villages had passive case detection (PCD) of fever system using village health workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Methods: Four malariometric cross-sectional surveys were conducted between November 2005 and May 2007 among individuals aged 0–19 years, living in lowland urban, lowland rural and highland strata. A total of 10,766 blood samples were collected for malaria parasite diagnosis and anaemia estimation. Blood smears were stained with Giemsa while haemoglobin level was measured by HaemoCue. Socio-economic data were collected between Jan-Apr 2006.                                                                                                                                                 Results: Adjusting for the effect of age, the risk of Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia was significantly lower in both lowland urban, (OR = 0.26; 95%CI: 0.23–0.29, p < 0.001) and highlands, (OR = 0.21; 95%CI: 0.17–0.25, p < 0.001) compared to lowland rural. Individuals aged 6–9 years in the lowland rural and 4–19 years in both lowland urban and highlands had the highest parasite prevalence, whilst children below five years in all strata had the highest parasite density. Prevalence of splenomegaly and gametocyte were also lower in both lowland urban and highlands than in lowland rural. Anaemia (Hb <11 g/dl) prevalence was lowest in the lowland urban. Availability of PCD and higher socio-economic status (SES) were associated with reduced malaria and anaemia prevalence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Conclusion: Higher SES and use of bed nets in the lowland urban could be the important factors for low malaria infections in this stratum. Results obtained here were used together with those from PCD and DSS in selecting a village for Phase 1b MSP3 vaccine trial, which was conducted in the study area in year 2008."

Moreover, much less is known about the utilisation of postnatal care, by which we mean the care of mother and baby that begins one hour after the delivery until six weeks after childbirth. We describe the perspectives and experiences of women and health care providers on the use of antenatal and postnatal services.                                                                                                                    Methods: From March 2007 to January 2008, we conducted in-depth interviews with health care providers and village based informants in 8 villages of Lindi Rural and Tandahimba districts in southern Tanzania. Eight focus group discussions were also conducted with women who had babies younger than one year and pregnant women. The discussion guide included information about timing of antenatal and postnatal services, perceptions of the rationale and importance of antenatal and postnatal care, barriers to utilisation and suggestions for improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Results: Women were generally positive about both antenatal and postnatal care. Among common reasons mentioned for late initiation of antenatal care was to avoid having to make several visits to the clinic. Other concerns included fear of encountering wild animals on the way to the clinic as well as lack of money. Fear of caesarean section was reported as a factor hindering intrapartum care-seeking from hospitals. Despite the perceived benefits of postnatal care for children, there was a total lack of postnatal care for the mothers. Shortages of staff, equipment and supplies were common complaints in the community.                                                                                                                                                                                  Conclusion: Efforts to improve antenatal and postnatal care should focus on addressing geographical and economic access while striving to make services more culturally sensitive. Antenatal and postnatal care can offer important opportunities for linking the health system and the community by encouraging women to deliver with a skilled attendant. Addressing staff shortages through expanding training opportunities and incentives to health care providers and developing postnatal care guidelines are key steps to improve maternal and newborn health."

(2009) Assessment of the experiences and coping strategies of people working in the informal sector in their quest to access health care services: the case of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. BioScience Trends 3 (1), 3-16."," Assessment of the experiences and coping strategies of people working in the informal sector in their quest to access health care services: the case of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania", health care service,BioScience Trends ,2009,3,1,3,16,2,,,,,,,,,"Addressing inequities in health care provision and financing has been at the center stage of Health Sector Reform (HSR) discussions since the early 1980s. The poor, women, and informal health sector workers in most developing countries are rarely covered by formal health insurance mechanisms that are meant to ensure access to essential health services. They are also sidelined in formal banking and credit systems due to their being predominantly low income earners, with little resources to meet eligibility criteria for borrowing and also to be considered creditworthy. In light of this fact, the present paper analyzes both quantitative and qualitative data in an attempt to explore and discuss the experiences and coping strategies of women and men employed in the informal sector economy in their daily attempts to access health care services. The paper employs Malaria as a tracer disease and gender as a unit of analysis. Analysis indicated the significance, as perceived by interviewees, of both informal credit networks and formal insurance and banking systems as important shock-absorbers for vulnerable populations in their struggle to access basic health services in times of need. The paper further highlights and discusses diverse coping strategies that households employ in dealing with illness-related costs and a greater willingness to be integrated into both formal and informal financial mechanisms. The paper finally concludes that the government must take the following steps: 1) enhance existing formal and communitybased initiatives to make them sustainable, 2) devise ways to reduce the lack of flexibility in membership requirements for insurance schemes/financial institutions, and 3) reduce perverse incentives inherent in the health system that may prevent people from seeking membership in available insurance mechanisms. In addition, deliberate steps must be taken by the government to employ 'targeted measures' to ensure that health care access is improved and sustained particularly for vulnerable populations"

Human Resources for Health 7:4.",Measuring inequities in the distribution of health workers: the case of Tanzania,health workers,Human Resources for Health ,2009,7,,4,  ,2,,,,,,,,,"Background: The overall human resource shortages and the distributional inequalities in the health workforce in many developing countries are well acknowledged. However, little has been done to measure the degree of inequality systematically. Moreover, few attempts have been made to analyse the implications of using alternative measures of health care needs in the measurement of health workforce distributional inequalities. Most studies have implicitly relied on population levels as the only criterion for measuring health care needs. This paper attempts to achieve two objectives. First, it describes and measures health worker distributional inequalities in Tanzania on a per capita basis; second, it suggests and applies additional health care needs indicators in the measurement of distributional inequalities.                                                                                                                                                                    Methods: We plotted Lorenz and concentration curves to illustrate graphically the distribution of the total health workforce and the cadre-specific (skill mix) distributions. Alternative indicators of health care needs were illustrated by concentration curves. Inequalities were measured by calculating Gini and concentration indices.                                                         Results: There are significant inequalities in the distribution of health workers per capita. Overall, the population quintile with the fewest health workers per capita accounts for only 8% of all health workers, while the quintile with the most health workers accounts for 46%. Inequality is perceptible across both urban and rural districts. Skill mix inequalities are also large. Districts with a small share of the health workforce (relative to their population levels have an even smaller share of highly trained medical personnel. A small share of highly trained personnel is compensated by a larger share of clinical officers (a middle-level cadre) but not by a larger share of untrained health workers. Clinical officers are relatively equally distributed. Distributional inequalities tend to be more pronounced when under-five deaths are used as an indicator of health care needs. Conversely, if health care needs are measured by HIV prevalence, the distributional inequalities appear to decline.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Conclusion: The measure of inequality in the distribution of the health workforce may depend strongly on the underlying measure of health care needs. In cases of a non-uniform distribution of health care needs across geographical areas, other measures of health care needs than population levels may have to be developed in order to ensure a more meaningful measurement of distributional inequalities of the health workforce."

These reforms were intended to relinquish substantial powers and resources to districts to improve the development of the health sector. Little is known about the impact of decentralisation on recruitment and distribution of health workers at the district level. Reported difficulties in recruiting health workers to remote districts led the Government of Tanzania to partly re-instate central recruitment of health workers in 2006. The effects of this policy change are not yet documented. This study highlights the experiences and challenges associated with decentralisation and the partial re-centralisation in relation to the recruitment and distribution of health workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Methods: An exploratory qualitative study was conducted among informants recruited from five underserved, remote districts of mainland Tanzania. Additional informants were recruited from the central government, the NGO sector, international organisations and academia. A comparison of decentralised and the reinstated centralised systems was carried out in order to draw lessons necessary for improving recruitment, distribution and retention of health workers.                                                                                                                                  Results: The study has shown that recruitment of health workers under a decentralised arrangement has not only been characterised by complex bureaucratic procedures, but by severe delays and sometimes failure to get the required health workers. The study also revealed that recruitment of highly skilled health workers under decentralised arrangements may be both very difficult and expensive. Decentralised recruitment was perceived to be more effective in improving retention of the lower cadre health workers within the districts. In contrast, the centralised arrangement was perceived to be more effective both in recruiting qualified staff and balancing their distribution across districts, but poor in ensuring the retention of employees.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Conclusion: A combination of centralised and decentralised recruitment represents a promising hybrid form of health sector organisation in managing human resources by bringing the benefits of two worlds together. In order to ensure that the potential benefits of the two approaches are effectively integrated, careful balancing defining the local-central relationships in the management of human resources needs to be worked out."

Drugs have greater risks in pregnancy and determining the safety and efficacy of drugs in pregnancy is therefore a priority. This study set out to determine the efficacy and safety of several antimalarial drugs and combinations in pregnant women with uncomplicated malaria.   Methods: Pregnant women with non-severe, slide proven, falciparum malaria were randomised to one of 4 regimes: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine [SP]; chlorproguanil-dapsone [CD]; SP+amodiaquine [SP+AQ] or amodiaquine+artesunate [AQ+AS]. Randomisation was on a 1?2?2?2 ratio. Women were admitted for treatment, and followed at days 7, 14, 21, 28 after the start of treatment, at delivery and 6 weeks after delivery to determine adverse events, clinical and parasitological outcomes. Primary outcome was parasitological failure by day Results:1433 pregnant women were screened, of whom 272 met entry criteria and were randomised; 28 to SP, 81 to CD, 80 to SP+AQ and 83 to AQ+AS. Follow-up to day 28 post treatment was 251/272 (92%), and to 6 weeks following delivery 91%. By day 28 parasitological failure rates were 4/26 (15%, 95%CI 4–35) in the SP, 18/77 (23%, 95%CI 14–34) in the CD, 1/73 (1% 95%CI 7–0.001) in the SP+AQ and 7/75 (9% 95%CI 4–18) in the AQ+AS arms respectively. After correction by molecular markers for reinfection the parasitological failure rates at day 28 were 18% for CD, 1% for SP+AQ and 4.5% for AQ+AS. There were two maternal deaths during the trial. There was no apparent excess of stillbirths or adverse birth outcomes in any arm. Parasitological responses were strikingly better in pregnant women than in children treated with the same drugs at this site.                                                                                                 Conclusions: Failure rates with monotherapy were unacceptably high. The two combinations tested were efficacious and appeared safe.

This study was carried out to determine the extent to which the CDI process can be used for the delivery of other health interventions with different degrees of complexity. The study was conducted in five districts of Kilosa, Muheza, Lushoto, Korogwe and Ulanga in Tanzania and involved communities, health facility and district healthcare providers. Implementation of CDI across these health interventions involved addressing six major processes, namely, stakeholder processes, health system dynamics, engaging communities, empowering communities, engaging CDI implementers and broader system effects. Community and health systems changes were triggered, such that the inherent value of community involvement and empowerment could be internalized by communities and health workers, leading to a more receptive health system. The CDI process was accepted at the community levels as many were willing and ready to adopt the approach. Health workers at community levels were readily available and supportive of the process. Additionally, noted were the verified willingness and ability of community implementers to deliver multiple interventions; confirmed efficiency of CDI leading to cost savings at health systems level; increasing interest of the health system in CDI; interest of health workers in the process of integrated planning. However, there were factors that may have a negative influence on the CDI process. Drug and supply policy for CDI process was lacking at the national and district levels and the presence of parallel community-based programmes that provide financial incentives for community members to run them discouraged Community-directed distributors who in most cases are volunteers. In conclusion, the results have clearly and evidently demonstrated the potential of CDI approach for effectively and efficiently control of other diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and childhood illnesses. The study has provided unique information on the feasibility and effectiveness of integrated delivery of interventions at the community level."

Several species of Azolla are reportedly indigenous to Tanzania. However, the potential of Azolla as a biocontrol agent against malaria mosquitoes has not been evaluated in the country. This cross-sectional study was carried out to assess mosquito larval productivity in irrigated rice-fields infested with Azolla in Mvomero District, Tanzania. A systematic larval sampling covering all open water bodies along designed transect was carried in rice-fields. Larval density was estimated by dipping water bodies with or without Azolla. The degree of Azolla coverage was categorized as 0%, <50%, 50%, and >80%. Larvae densities were categorised as low (<50/m2), medium (50-500/m2) and high (> or = 500/m2) productivity. A total of 120 water bodies were surveyed and 105 (87.5%) had Azolla microphyla and A. pinnata at varying degrees of coverage. Of the total 105 water bodies with Azolla, 80 (76.2%) had a green Azolla mat, and 25 (23.8%) a brown Azolla mat. Eighty-eight (73.3%) of the sites were infested with anophelines and 109 (90.8%) with culicine larvae. Seventy percent of all water bodies contained anophelines and culicines in sympatric breeding, while 20.8% and 3.3% had only culicines and anophelines, respectively. The majority (82%) of mosquito breeding sites were found in area with Azolla substrate. Mosquito larva productivity was low in sites with highest (>80%) Azolla coverage. Seventy-two (81.8%) of the anopheline and 90 (82.6%) culicine breeding sites were infested with Azolla. Water bodies infested with green Azolla were more productive than those covered by brown coloured Azolla substrates for both culicines (13%) and anophelines (8%). Of the 1537 field collected larvae that hatched to adult stage, 646 (42.03%) were Anopheles gambiae s.l., 42 (2.73%) were An. funestus and 769 (50.03%) were Culex quinquefasciatus. These findings suggest that the mosquito productivity is low when the Azolla coverage is high (>80%). The promotion of Azolla in mosquito control should take into consideration the degree of Azolla coverage."

Currently, one of the defining criteria for suspecting tuberculosis is cough for two weeks or more. We wanted to find out whether the prevalence of tuberculosis was different in patients who reported cough for two weeks or more, compared to patients with cough for less than two weeks. We conducted a cross sectional study in six health facilities in Dar es Salaam, between September and October 2007. All patients aged five years and above with cough were screened for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) by smear microscopy. Patients were divided into two groups, those who coughed for less than two weeks (<2 wks) and those who coughed for two weeks or more (> or = 2 wks). A total of 65,530 patients attended outpatients department (OPD). Out of these, 2274 (3.5%) patients reported cough. Among patients who reported cough, 2214 (97.4%) remembered their cough duration. One thousand nine hundred and seventy three patients (89.1%) coughed for >/= 2 wks as compared to 241 (10.9%) patients who coughed for <2 wks. Of those who coughed for two weeks or more, 250 (12.7%) had smear positive PTB, and of those who had coughed for less than two weeks, 21 (8.7%) had smear positive PTB. There was no statistically significant difference in prevalence of smear positive tuberculosis among the two groups (Pearson Chi-Square 3.2; p = 0.074).

Delays were divided into patient, health facility and total delay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 226 smear positive TB patients. Out of 226 patient's results were available for 206. The majority (66.5%) of the patients were males. Mean age for males and females were 37.3 and 33.7 years respectively. Mean (SD) total delay was 125.5 (98.5) days (median 90). Out of 206 patients, 79 (38.35%) delayed to seek TB health care. Health facility delay was observed among 121 (58.7%) patients.Risk factors for delay was poor knowledge that chest pain may be a TB symptom (OR = 2.9; 95%CI 1.20- 7.03) and the belief that TB is always associated with HIV/AIDS (OR = 2.7; 95%CI 1.39-5.23). Risk for delay was low among patients who first presented to a government health facility (OR = 0.3; 95%CI 0.12- 0.71) and those presenting with chest pain (OR = 0.2; 95%CI 0.10-0.61).                                                                                                                                                                                                             CONCLUSION: There is a considerable delay in TB case detection in Pwani mainly contributed by patients. Risk factors for delay include misconception about TB/HIV and poor knowledge of TB symptoms."

This study was conducted to determine the proportion of smear positive TB among women with cough regardless of the duration attending family Planning (FP) and Maternal and child health (MCH) clinics in Dar es Salaam. Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study in all three municipal hospitals of Dar es Salaam, between October 2007 and June 2008. All women with cough attending FP and MCH clinics were screened for TB by smear microscopy. Pearson chi-square was used to compare group difference for categorical variables. Risk factors for smear positive were estimated by logistics regression with 95% confidence intervals (CI) given for odds ratios indicating statistically significant relationship if the CI did not include one. Results: We enrolled a total of 749 TB suspects. Five hundred and twenty nine patients (70.6%) were from MCH clinics. Mean (SD) age was 27.6 (5.2) years. A total of 616 (82.2%) patients were coughing for less than two weeks as compared to 133 (17.8%), who coughed for two or more weeks. Among 616 TB suspects, 14 (2.3%) were smear positive TB patients, and of the 133 who had coughed for two or more weeks, 13 (9.8%) were smear positive TB patients. Risk factors associated with smear positive results were having attended more than one visit to any facility prior to diagnosis (OR = 6.8; 95%CI 2.57–18.0) and having HIV/AIDS (OR = 4.4; 95%CI 1.65–11.96). Long duration of cough was not a risk factor for being smear positive (OR = 1.6; 95%CI 0.59–4.49). Conclusion: The proportion of smear positive TB patients among women with cough attending MCH and FP was 3.8%. Visits to any health facility prior to Diagnosis and HIV infection were risk for having a smear positive TB."

In collaboration with local stakeholders, we designed and assessed a referral system to link persons diagnosed at a voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) clinic in a rural district in northern Tanzania with a government-run HIV treatment clinic in a nearby city.                                        METHODS: Two-part referral forms, with unique matching numbers on each side were implemented to facilitate access to the HIV clinic, and were subsequently reconciled to monitor the proportion of diagnosed clients who registered for these services, stratified by sex and referral period. Delays between referral and registration at the HIV clinic were calculated, and lists of non-attendees were generated to facilitate tracing among those who had given prior consent for follow up.Transportation allowances and a ""community escort"" from a local home-based care organization were introduced for patients attending the HIV clinic, with supportive counselling services provided by the VCT counsellors and home-based care volunteers. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted with health care workers and patients to assess the acceptability of the referral procedures.                     RESULTS: Referral uptake at the HIV clinic averaged 72% among men and 66% among women during the first three years of the national antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme, and gradually increased following the introduction of the transportation allowances and community escorts, but declined following a national VCT campaign. Most patients reported that the referral system facilitated their arrival at the HIV clinic, but expressed a desire for HIV treatment services to be in closer proximity to their homes. The referral forms proved to be an efficient and accepted method for assessing the effectiveness of the VCT clinic as an entry point for ART.                                                                                                                                     CONCLUSION: The referral system reduced delays in seeking care, and enabled the monitoring of access to HIV treatment among diagnosed persons. Similar systems to monitor referral uptake and linkages between HIV services could be readily implemented in other settings."

Methods: With a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the African Malaria Network Trust (AMANET) undertook a survey of 31 ethics review committees (ERCs) across sub-Saharan Africa as an initial step to a comprehensive capacity-strengthening programme. The number of members per committee ranged from 3 to 21, with an average of 11. Members of 10 institutional committees were all from the institution where the committees were based, raising prima facie questions as to whether independence and objectivity could be guaranteed in the review work of such committees. Results: The majority of the committees (92%) cited scientific design of clinical trials as the area needing the most attention in terms of training, followed by determination of risks and benefits and monitoring of research. The survey showed that 38% of the ERC members did not receive any form of training. In the light of the increasing complexity and numbers of health research studies being conducted in Africa, this deficit requires immediate attention. Outcome: The survey identified areas of weakness in the operations of ERCs in Africa.

Qualitative research on ART patients' health-seeking behavior identified factors affecting sustained attendance at treatment clinics. A mix of methods was used for data collection including semi-structured interviews with 42 clients and 11 service providers and 4 participatory group activities conducted with members of a post-test group between October and December 2006. A socio-ecological framework guided data analysis to categorize facilitators and barriers into individual, social, programmatic, and structural level influences, and subsequently explored their interaction and relative significance in shaping ART clients' behavior. Our findings suggest that personal motivation and self-efficacy contribute to program retention, and are affected by other individual-level experiences such as perceived health benefits or disease severity. However, these determinants are influenced by others' opinions and beliefs in the community, and constrained by programmatic and structural barriers. Individuals can develop the requisite willingness to sustain strict treatment requirements in a challenging context, but are more likely to do so within supportive family and community environments. Effectiveness and sustainability of ART roll-out could be strengthened by strategic intervention at different levels, with particular attention to community-level factors such as social networks' influence and support"

Results: The complex interplay between ART, stigma and VCT in this setting is characterised by two powerful but opposing dynamics. The availability of effective treatment has transformed HIV into a manageable condition which is contributing to a reduction in self-stigma and is stimulating VCT uptake. However, this is counterbalanced by the persistence of blaming attitudes and emergence of new sources of stigma associated with ART provision. The general perception among community leaders was that as ART users regained health, they increasingly engaged in sexual relations and “spread the disease.” Fears were exacerbated because they were perceived to be very mobile and difficult to identify physically. Some leaders suggested giving ART recipients drugs “for impotence,” marking them “with a sign” and putting them “in isolation camps.” In this context, traditional beliefs about disease aetiology provided a less stigmatised explanation for HIV symptoms contributing to a situation of collective denial.                                                                                                              Conclusion: Where anticipated stigma prevails, provision of antiretroviral drugs alone is unlikely to have sufficient impact on VCT uptake. Achieving widespread public health benefits of ART roll-out requires community-level interventions to ensure local acceptability of antiretroviral drugs."

As part of a broader initiative to monitor the implementation of the national antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme, this qualitative study investigated the impact of ART availability on perceptions of HIV in a rural ward of North Tanzania and its implications for prevention. A mix of qualitative methods was used including semi-structured interviews with 53 ART clinic clients and service providers. Four group activities were conducted with persons living with HIV. Data were analyzed using the qualitative software package NVIVO-7. People on ART often reported feeling increasingly comfortable with their status reflecting a certain ""normalization"" of the disease. This was attributed to seeing other people affected by HIV, regaining physical health, returning to productive activities and receiving emotional support from health service providers. Overcoming internalized feelings of shame facilitated disclosure of HIV status, helped to sustain treatment, and stimulated VCT uptake. However ""blaming"" stigma - where people living with HIV were considered responsible for acquiring a ""moral disease"" - persisted in the community and anticipating it was a key barrier to disclosure and VCT uptake. Attributing HIV symptoms to witchcraft seemed an effective mechanism to transfer ""blame"" from the family unit to an external force but could lead to treatment interruption. As long as an HIV diagnosis continues to have moral connotations, a de-stigmatisation of HIV paralleling that occurring with diseases like cancer is unlikely to occur. Maximizing synergies between HIV treatment and prevention requires an enabling environment for HIV status disclosure, treatment continuation, and safer sexual behaviours. Local leaders should be informed and sensitised and communities mobilised to address the blame-dimension of HIV stigma.

PLoS One 4 (8):e6667.",Multiple var2csa-type PfEMP1 genes located at different chromosomal loci occur in many Plasmodium falciparum isolates,Malaria, PLoS One,2009,4,8,e6667,,8,,,,,,,,,"BACKGROUND: The var2csa gene encodes a Plasmodium falciparum adhesion receptor which binds chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). This var gene is more conserved than other PfEMP1/var genes and is found in all P. falciparum isolates. In isolates 3D7, FCR3/It4 and HB3, var2csa is transcribed from a sub-telomeric position on the left arm of chromosome 12, but it is not known if this location is conserved in all parasites. Genome sequencing indicates that the var2csa gene is duplicated in HB3, but whether this is true in natural populations is uncertain. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To assess global variation in the VAR2CSA protein, sequence variation in the DBL2X region of var2csa genes in 54 P.falciparum samples was analyzed. Chromosome mapping of var2csa loci was carried out and a quantitative PCR assay was developed to estimate the number of var2csa genes in P.falciparum isolates from the placenta of pregnant women and from the peripheral circulation of other malaria patients. Sequence analysis, gene mapping and copy number quantitation in P.falciparum isolates indicate that there are at least two loci and that both var2csa-like genes can be transcribed. All VAR2CSA DBL2X domains fall into one of two distinct phylogenetic groups possessing one or the other variant of a large (approximately 26 amino acid) dimorphic motif, but whether either motif variant is linked to a specific locus is not known.                        CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Two or more related but distinct var2csa-type PfEMP1/var genes exist in many P. falciparum isolates. One gene is on chromosome 12 but additional var2csa-type genes are on different chromosomes in different isolates. Multiplicity of var2csa genes appears more common in infected placentae than in samples from non-pregnant donors indicating a possible advantage of this genotype in pregnancy associated malaria."

This study was conducted in 12 villages to determine malariometric indices and associated risk factors, during long and short rainy seasons, in an area with varying malaria transmission intensities in Korogwe district, Tanzania. Four villages had passive case detection (PCD) of fever system using village health workers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         METHODS: Four malariometric cross-sectional surveys were conducted between November 2005 and May 2007 among individuals aged 0-19 years, living in lowland urban, lowland rural and highland strata. A total of 10,766 blood samples were collected for malaria parasite diagnosis and anaemia estimation. Blood smears were stained with Giemsa while haemoglobin level was measured by HaemoCue. Socio-economic data were collected between Jan-Apr 2006.                                                                                                                                          RESULTS: Adjusting for the effect of age, the risk of Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemia was significantly lower in both lowland urban, (OR = 0.26; 95%CI: 0.23-0.29, p < 0.001) and highlands, (OR = 0.21; 95%CI: 0.17-0.25, p < 0.001) compared to lowland rural. Individuals aged 6-9 years in the lowland rural and 4-19 years in both lowland urban and highlands had the highest parasite prevalence, whilst children below five years in all strata had the highest parasite density. Prevalence of splenomegaly and gametocyte were also lower in both lowland urban and highlands than in lowland rural. Anaemia (Hb <11 g/dl) prevalence was lowest in the lowland urban. Availability of PCD and higher socio-economic status (SES) were associated with reduced malaria and anaemia prevalence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           CONCLUSION: Higher SES and use of bed nets in the lowland urban could be the important factors for low malaria infections in this stratum.

We investigated factors influencing caretakers' adherence to referral advice following pre-referral treatment of their children with rectal artesunate suppositories. METHODS: The study was nested within an intervention study that involved pre-referral treatment of all children who came to a community dispenser for treatment because they were unable to take oral medications because of repeated vomiting, lethargy, convulsions or altered consciousness. All patients who did not comply with referral advice were stratified by actions taken post-referral: taking their children to a drug shop, a traditional healer, or not seeking further treatment, and added to a random selection of patients who complied with referral advice. Caretakers of the children were interviewed about their socio-economic status (SES), knowledge about malaria, referral advice given and actions they took following pre-referral treatment. Interview data for 587 caretakers were matched with symptoms of the children, the time of treatment, arrival at a health facility or other actions taken post-pre-referral treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        RESULTS: The majority (93.5%) of caretakers reported being given referral advice by the community drug dispenser. The odds of adherence with this advice were three times greater for children with altered consciousness and/or convulsions than for children with other symptoms [odds ratio (OR) 3.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.32-5.17, P < 0.001].

Cost did not influence adherence except within a catchment area of facilities that charged for services. In these areas, costs deterred adherence by four to five times for those who had previously paid for laboratory services (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.09-0.67, P = 0.006) or consultation (OR 0.20, 95% CI: 0.06-0.61, P = 0.005) compared with those who had not.

METHODS Nationally representative samples of facility-based deliveries were selected and observed to determine the use of active management of the third stage of labour and associated factors. Policies on active management were assessed through document review and interviews with relevant professionals. FINDINGS Use of a uterotonic during the third or fourth stages of labour was nearly universal. Correct use of active management of the third stage of labour was found in only 0.5% to 32% of observed deliveries due to multiple deficiencies in practice. In every country except Indonesia, policies regarding active management were conflicting. CONCLUSION Developing countries have not targeted decreasing postpartum haemorrhage as an achievable goal; there is little use of active management of the third stage of labour, and policies regarding such management often conflict. Studies are needed to identify the most effective components of active management so that the most efficient package of practices can be promoted."

Rapid, local estimates of transmission are required to focus resources better but current entomological and parasitological methods for estimating transmission intensity are limited in this respect. An alternative is determination of antimalarial antibody age-specific sero-prevalence to estimate sero-conversion rates (SCR), which have been shown to correlate with transmission intensity. This study evaluated SCR generated from samples collected from health facility attendees as a tool for a rapid assessment of malaria transmission intensity.                       Methodology and Principal Findings: The study was conducted in north east Tanzania. Antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite antigens MSP-119 and AMA-1 were measured by indirect ELISA. Age-specific antibody prevalence was analysed using a catalytic conversion model based on maximum likelihood to generate SCR. A pilot study, conducted near Moshi, found SCRs for AMA-1 were highly comparable between samples collected from individuals in a conventional cross-sectional survey and those collected from attendees at a local health facility. For the main study, 3885 individuals attending village health facilities in Korogwe and Same districts were recruited. Both malaria parasite prevalence and sero-positivity were higher in Korogwe than in Same. MSP-119 and AMA-1 SCR rates for Korogwe villages ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.07 to 0.21 respectively. In Same district there was evidence of a recent reduction in transmission, with SCR among those born since 1998 [MSP-119 0.002 to 0.008 and AMA-1 0.005 to 0.014 ] being 5 to 10 fold lower than among individuals born prior to 1998 [MSP-119 0.02 to 0.04 and AMA-1 0.04 to 0.13]. Current health facility specific estimates of SCR showed good correlations with malaria incidence rates in infants in a contemporaneous clinical trial (MSP-119 r2?=?0.78, p<0.01 & AMA-1 r2?=?0.91, p<0.001).                                                                                                                                                                      Conclusions: SCRs generated from age-specific anti-malarial antibody prevalence data collected via health facility surveys were robust and credible. Analysis of SCR allowed detection of a recent drop in malaria transmission in line with recent data from other areas in the region. This health facility-based approach represents a potential tool for rapid assessment of recent trends in malaria transmission intensity, generating valuable data for local and national malaria control programs to target, monitor and evaluate their control strategies."

Malaria and bacterial disease are difficult to differentiate with limited diagnostic facilities. Combinations of antibiotics and antimalarials are potentially attractive for treatment of the syndrome. Azithromycin plus artesunate (AT+AS) is an effective antimalarial combination for adults in Asia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  METHODS: We performed an individually randomized, open-label trial of AZ+AS versus artemether-lumefantrine (AL) involving children (age, 6-59 months) with uncomplicated malaria in Muheza, Tanzania. The primary outcome was parasitological failure by day 28. Parasitological failure by day 42 and failure corrected for reinfection were major secondary outcomes.   RESULTS: Of 2497 children screened, 261 were eligible; 129 were randomized to the AZ+AS arm, and 132 were randomized to the AL arm; 92% and 91%, respectively, underwent follow-up to 28 days. Planned interim analysis was performed after 200 patients reached day 28 follow-up and led the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to halt further recruitment. All children had a complete initial response to treatment, but 69 (58%) of 119 children in the AZ+AS arm and 24 (20%) of 120 in the AL arm had asexual parasites at or by day 28 (adjusted odds ratio for failure with AZ+AS treatment, 6.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.3-11.4; P < .001). When analysis was restricted to children with recrudescence, the parasitological failure rate was 32% in the AZ+AS arm and 9% in the AL arm. This difference was maintained at day 42.

Key amongst these is the question of what constitutes an appropriate standard of health care (SoC) for participants in HIV prevention trials. This paper describes a community-focused approach to develop a locally-appropriate SoC in the context of a phase III vaginal microbicide trial in Mwanza City, northwest Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                            METHODS: A mobile community-based sexual and reproductive health service for women working as informal food vendors or in traditional and modern bars, restaurants, hotels and guesthouses has been established in 10 city wards. Wards were divided into geographical clusters and community representatives elected at cluster and ward level. A city-level Community Advisory Committee (CAC) with representatives from each ward has been established. Workshops and community meetings at ward and city-level have explored project-related concerns using tools adapted from participatory learning and action techniques e.g. chapati diagrams, pair-wise ranking. Secondary stakeholders representing local public-sector and non-governmental health and social care providers have formed a trial Stakeholders' Advisory Group (SAG), which includes two CAC representatives.                                  RESULTS: Key recommendations from participatory community workshops, CAC and SAG meetings conducted in the first year of the trial relate to the quality and range of clinic services provided at study clinics as well as broader standard of care issues. Recommendations have included streamlining clinic services to reduce waiting times, expanding services to include the children and spouses of participants and providing care for common local conditions such as malaria. Participants, community representatives and stakeholders felt there was an ethical obligation to ensure effective access to antiretroviral drugs and to provide supportive community-based care for women identified as HIV positive during the trial. This obligation includes ensuring sustainable, post-trial access to these services. Post-trial access to an effective vaginal microbicide was also felt to be a moral imperative.                          CONCLUSION: Participatory methodologies enabled effective partnerships between researchers, participant representatives and community stakeholders to be developed and facilitated local dialogue and consensus on what constitutes a locally-appropriate standard of care in the context of a vaginal microbicide trial in this setting."

Factors independently associated with good adherence (taking >or=90% of tablets in the preceding 3-months) included older age, understanding trial concepts at enrolment, living >2 years in the screening site, receiving an unannounced tablet check visit, using oral contraception at screening, living in the same site and house as the previous visit, accessing VCT during the trial, recent malaria and not having a positive pregnancy test. Overall, 55% of urine samples from women randomised to acyclovir had detectable acyclovir.

To utilise African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys gambianus) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in human sputum. A specially designed cage with 10 sniffing holes and cassette-carrier was used. The sputum samples were put in the sample cassette, containing 10 samples in line, placed under matching sniffing holes. Rats were trained to sniff each consecutive sample, and indicate TB positives by fixing their nose for 5 seconds at the sniffing hole. This behaviour was maintained by food reinforcement upon correct indications. A total of 3416 samples were used. Of the 20 trained rats, 18 were able to discriminate positive from negative sputum samples, with average daily sensitivities ranging from 72% to 100%, and average daily false-positives ranging from 0.7% to 8.1%. The use of multiple rats significantly increased sensitivity and negative predictive value. Utilising trained sniffer rats for TB detection is a potentially faster screening method and is at least as sensitive as smear microscopy. This method could therefore be suitable for active case finding, especially where large numbers of samples are to be analysed in resource-limited settings, to complement existing diagnostic techniques."

Simple blood collection methods for use in field settings will make this more feasible. This paper describes validation of such a method, by analysing immunoglobulins from blood retained within immunophoretic rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for Plasmodium falciparum. RDTs are now widely used for the diagnosis of malaria and estimation of parasite rates, and this method represents a further use for these devices in malaria control. Immunoglobulins eluted from RDTs, designed to detect parasite histidine rich protein-2 (HRP-2), were analysed by indirect ELISA for IgG recognizing the P. falciparum blood stage antigens merozoite surface protein-1(19) (MSP-1(19)) and apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1). Optimal storage conditions for RDTs were evaluated by comparing antibody responses from RDTs stored in dry or humid conditions at 4 degrees C or at ambient temperature (with or without air-conditioning) for 7, 31 or 70 days. Antibody levels estimated using 3,700 RDT samples from attendees at health facilities in North-eastern Tanzania were compared with contemporaneously collected filter paper blood spots (FPBS) and used to estimate seroconversion rates. Storage of RDTs at 4 degrees C was optimal for immunoglobulin recovery but short-term storage at ambient temperatures did not substantially affect anti-malarial IgG levels. Results from RDTs were comparable with those from FPBSs, for both antigens. RDT-generated titres tended to be slightly higher than those generated from FPBSs, possibly due to greater recovery of immunoglobulins from RDTs compared to filter paper. Importantly, however, RDT-based seroconversion rates, and hence serological estimates of malaria transmission intensity, agreed closely with those from FPBSs. RDTs represent a practical option for collecting blood for sero-epidemiological surveys, with potential cost and logistical advantages over filter paper and other blood collection methods. RDT-based seroepidemiology can be incorporated into routine monitoring of malaria endemicity, providing information to supplement parasite prevalence rates and generating rapid, robust assessment of malaria transmission intensity at minimal extra cost."

This study explores factors influencing attendance at HIV clinic appointments among patients in a rural ward in north-west Tanzania. Forty-two in-depth interviews (IDI) and four focus group discussions were conducted with HIV-infected persons who had been referred to a nearby antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic, and IDI were undertaken with 11 healthcare workers involved in diagnosis, referral and care of HIV-positive patients. The Health Belief Model was applied to explore the role of health-related beliefs and the perceived barriers and benefits associated with regular clinic attendance. Perceived susceptibility to HIV-related illnesses emerged as an important factor influencing clinic attendance, and was often manifest through expressions of acceptance or denial of HIV status and knowledge of HIV disease progression. Denial of HIV status was often associated with using alternative healers, and could occur prior to, during, or after starting ART. Perceptions of illness severity also influenced HIV clinic attendance, and often evolved in relation to changes in physical symptoms. Barriers to clinic attendance frequently included health systems factors, while physical and social benefits encouraged regular clinic attendance. Self-confidence in being able to sustain clinic attendance was often determined by patients' expectations or experiences of family support. These findings suggest that multi-faceted interventions are required to promote regular HIV clinic attendance, including on-going education, counselling and support in both clinic and community settings. These interventions also need to recognise the evolving needs of patients that accompany changes in physical health, and should address local beliefs around HIV aetiology. Decentralisation of HIV services to rural communities should be considered as a priority to redress the balance between perceived barriers to, and benefits of accessing HIV treatment programmes."

In 10-year birth cohorts born between 1950–9 and 1980–9, male median AFS declined from 18.1 to 17.0 years and female median AFM rose from 16.2 to 16.6 years. Young people of both sexes currently spend longer sexually active but unmarried than previously. Early marriage is statistically associated with remarriage and polygamy; longer time between sexual debut and marriage is associated with higher numbers of partners at later stages of life.                                                                                                                                                                         Conclusion: Inconsistent reporting of age-at-event introduces noise but does not bias estimates of population level indicators. Lengthening time spent single and sexually active suggests that men and women entering first marriage will have been exposed to increased numbers of non-marital partners.

This study investigated the timing of delivery of IPTp to pregnant women attending antenatal clinics (ANC), and the potential determinants of timely uptake.                                                                                                                                                    METHODS: Structured interviews were conducted with staff and pregnant women at antenatal clinics in northeast Tanzania, and antenatal consultations were observed. Facility-based and individual factors were analysed for any correlation with timing of IPTp uptake.                                                                                                                                                                                       RESULTS: Almost half the women interviewed first attended ANC during or before the fourth month of gestation, however 86% of these early attendees did not receive IPTp on their first visit. The timing of IPTp delivery complied closely with the national guidelines which stipulate giving the first dose at 20-24 weeks gestation. Uptake of at least one dose of IPTp among women who had reached this gestation age was 67%, although this varied considerably between clinics. At one facility, IPTp was not delivered because SP was out of stock.         CONCLUSION: Early uptake of IPTp was found to be hampered by factors external to health worker performance or women's individual preferences. These include insufficient drug stocks and an apparent lack of information to health workers on the reasoning for continued use of SP for IPTp when it has been replaced as a first-line treatment. In addition, an unexpectedly high proportion of women attend antenatal clinics before 20 weeks of pregnancy. While current policy denies the use of IPTp at this time, there is emerging, but incomplete, evidence that malaria in early pregnancy may contribute considerably to the burden of pregnancy-related malaria. Current policy may thus result in a missed opportunity for maximising the benefit of this intervention, and efforts to encourage earlier attendance at ANC alone are unlikely to improve uptake of IPTp. More evidence is needed to weigh the benefits of early IPTp use against theoretical risks of antifolate drugs in early pregnancy."

We documented availability of health workers, vaccines, drugs, supplies and services essential for child health through a survey of all health facilities in the area. We did a representative cluster sample survey of 21,600 households using a modular questionnaire including household assets, birth histories, and antenatal care in currently pregnant women. In a subsample of households we asked about health of all children under two years, including breastfeeding, mosquito net use, vaccination, vitamin A, and care-seeking for recent illness, and measured haemoglobin and malaria parasitaemia. In the health facility survey, a prescriber or nurse was present on the day of the survey in about 40% of 114 dispensaries. Less than half of health facilities had all seven 'essential oral treatments', and water was available in only 22%. In the household survey, antenatal attendance (88%) and DPT-HepB3 vaccine coverage in children (81%) were high. Neonatal and infant mortality were 43.2 and 76.4 per 1000 live births respectively. Infant mortality was 40% higher for teenage mothers than older women (RR 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 - 1.7), and 20% higher for mothers with no formal education than those who had been to school (RR 1.2, CI 1.0 - 1.4). The benefits of education on survival were apparently restricted to post-neonatal infants. There was no evidence of inequality in infant mortality by socio-economic status. Vaccine coverage, net use, anaemia and parasitaemia were inequitable: the least poor had a consistent advantage over children from the poorest families. Infant mortality was higher in families living over 5 km from their nearest health facility compared to those living closer (RR 1.25, CI 1.0 - 1.5): 75% of households live within this distance. Relatively short distances to health facilities, high antenatal and vaccine coverage show that peripheral health facilities have huge potential to make a difference to health and survival at household level in rural Tanzania, even with current human resources.

A total of 425 subjects aged 10 years or more from 14 villages within Bwakira district ofMorogoro region in Tanzania were examined for Snellen visual acuity, ocular microfilaria, lens opacities, uveitis and posterior segment disease especially chorioretinitis and optic nerve disease. Motion Sensitivity Screening Test (MSST) was carried out as well. Microfilaria was present in the anterior chamber of nearly half (49.2%) of all subjects examined. Prevalence of blindness was extremely high at 15.2%. Onchocercal lesions were responsible for blindness in 41.5% of these, followed by cataracts (27.7%), glaucoma (10.8%) and trachoma (6.2%). The main pathway to onchocercal blindness in this population was anterior uveitis with or without secondary cataracts. There is an urgent need to get CDTI underway and institute other horizontal primary eye care measures, especially cataract backlog reduction, in order to reduce the excessive burden of avoidable blindness in this community."

A previous study of the malaria vaccine RTS,S (which targets the circumsporozoite protein), given with an adjuvant system (AS02A), showed a 30% rate of protection against clinical malaria in children 1 to 4 years of age. We evaluated the efficacy of RTS,S given with a more immunogenic adjuvant system (AS01E) in children 5 to 17 months of age, a target population for vaccine licensure.                                                                                                                   METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial of RTS,S/AS01E vaccine as compared with rabies vaccine in children in Kilifi, Kenya, and Korogwe, Tanzania. The primary end point was fever with a falciparum parasitemia density of more than 2500 parasites per microliter, and the mean duration of follow-up was 7.9 months (range, 4.5 to 10.5).            RESULTS: A total of 894 children were randomly assigned to receive the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine or the control (rabies) vaccine. Among the 809 children who completed the study procedures according to the protocol, the cumulative number in whom clinical malaria developed was 32 of 402 assigned to receive RTS,S/AS01E and 66 of 407 assigned to receive the rabies vaccine; the adjusted efficacy rate for RTS,S/AS01E was 53% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28 to 69; P<0.001) on the basis of Cox regression. Overall, there were 38 episodes of clinical malaria among recipients of RTS,S/AS01E, as compared with 86 episodes among recipients of the rabies vaccine, with an adjusted rate of efficacy against all malarial episodes of 56% (95% CI, 31 to 72; P<0.001). All 894 children were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, which showed an unadjusted efficacy rate of 49% (95% CI, 26 to 65; P<0.001). There were fewer serious adverse events among recipients of RTS,S/AS01E, and this reduction was not only due to a difference in the number of admissions directly attributable to malaria.

However, ELISA only measures one analyte at a time and requires a relatively large plasma volume if the complete antibody profile of the sample is to be obtained. Furthermore, assay-to-assay variation and the problem of storage of antigen can influence ELISA results. The bead-based assay described here uses the BioPlex100 (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) system which can quantify multiple antibodies simultaneously in a small plasma volume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Methods: A total of twenty nine PfEMP1 domains were PCR amplified from 3D7 genomic DNA, expressed in the Baculovirus system and purified by metal-affinity chromatography. The antibody reactivity level to the recombinant PfEMP1 proteins in human hyper-immune plasma was measured by ELISA. In parallel, these recombinant PfEMP1 proteins were covalently coupled onto beads each having its own unique detection signal and the human hyper-immune plasma reactivity was detected for each individual protein using a BioPlex100 system. Protein-coupled beads were analysed at two time points seven months apart, before and after lyophilization and the results compared to determine the effect of storage and lyophilization respectively on the beads. Multiplexed protein-coupled beads from twenty eight unique bead populations were evaluated on the BioPlex100 system against pooled human hyper-immune plasma before and after lyophilization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Results: The bead-based assay was sensitive, accurate and reproducible. Four recombinant PfEMP1 proteins C17, D5, D9 and D12, selected on the basis that they showed a spread of median fluorescent intensity (MFI) values from low to high when analysed by the bead-based assay were analysed by ELISA and the results from both analyses were highly correlated. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (Rho) were ? 0.86, (P < 0.0001) for all comparisons. Bead-based assays gave similar results regardless of whether they were performed on individual beads or on multiplexed beads; lyophilization had no impact on the assay performance. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (Rho) were ? 0.97, (P < 0.0001) for all comparisons. Importantly, the reactivity of protein-coupled non-lyophilized beads decreased with long term storage at 4°C in the dark.                                                                                     Conclusion: Using this lyophilized multiplex assay, antibody reactivity levels to twenty eight different recombinant PfEMP1 proteins were simultaneously measured using a single microliter of plasma. Thus, the assay reported here provides a useful tool for rapid and efficient quantification of antibody reactivity against PfEMP1 variants in human plasma."

Methods: Patients and health staff in three districts were interviewed to assess the burden of the current treatment strategy, and opinions on a proposed new strategy where patients are able to choose the place of treatment and the treatment supervisor, and receive treatment as a daily combination tablet. Results: The study included 343 patients in 42 facilities. Daily collection of drugs was perceived as burdensome irrespective of distance needed to travel. Eighty percent of patients viewed medication taken at home or at a closer health facility as an improvement in TB-services. The proposed new treatment strategy was rated favorably by 85% of patients and 75% of health staff. Fifty-three percent of patients would opt for home-based treatment, and 75% would choose a family member or the spouse as treatment supporter. Conclusion: Home-based supervision of TB treatment with fewer drugs is an expressed preference of TB patients in Tanzania. Such a strategy is now being assessed in a pilot study. If effective and feasible, the strategy will contribute to an improved TB control strategy."

The study was performed in an area of intense malaria transmission where 202 individuals 0-19 years of age were monitored clinically for a period of 6 months. RBC polymorphisms were assessed with molecular methods, and plasma antibodies to P. falciparum variant surface antigens (anti-VSA IgG) and glutamate-rich protein (anti-GLURP IgG) were measured with flow cytometry and ELISA assays, respectively. Regression analyses showed that alpha(+)-thalassemia was associated with a reduced risk of uncomplicated malaria episodes and that this advantageous effect seemed to be more predominant in children older than 5 years of age, but was independent of levels of antibodies to VSA and GLURP."

No relationship was detected between clinical outcome and DHFR/DHPS genotypes, but the point mutation prevalence in parasites was higher than in 1999. Pre-treatment blood levels of SP were detected in a quarter of the study children: less than expected. We report unacceptably high levels of total treatment failures, both for first- and second-line treatments for uncomplicated malaria in Tanzania 3 years after their introduction, supporting the decision to replace them with artemisinin-based combination therapy."

A cross-sectional study was conducted among pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients in Mwanza, Tanzania to identify the predictors of their vitamin D status. Data on sociodemography, season, and intake of food, alcohol, tobacco, and soil were collected, anthropometric measurements taken, and serum alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT), ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and serum 25-hydroxy-(ergocalciferol+cholecalciferol) [25(OH)D] determined. Of the 655 patients studied, 79.7% (508/637) were culture-positive (PTB+) and 47.2% HIV infected. Mean serum ACT, an acute phase reactant, was 0.73 +/- 0.25 g/L with 69.2% >0.6 g/L. Mean serum 25(OH)D was 86.6 +/- 32.9 nmol/L, with 41.2% <75 nmol/L. Serum 25(OH)D was highest during the harvest season, May to July, compared with the remaining year. Single subjects had lower [10.4 (95% CI 4.0; 16.9) nmol/L] serum 25(OH)D concentrations than married subjects and PTB+ patients had concentrations lower [8.2 (95% CI 1.5; 14.9) nmol/L] than PTB- patients. Serum 25(OH)D increased with consumption of a large freshwater fish but not of small dried fish or other foods. BMI and serum TfR were positive predictors of serum 25(OH)D, whereas neither elevated serum ACT nor HIV were predictors. In conclusion, serum 25(OH)D is a valid measure of vitamin D status during the acute phase response. The lower concentrations in PTB+ patients may reflect lower sun exposure or increased utilization. The health consequences of hypovitaminosis D in low-income equatorial populations, at risk for both infectious and chronic diseases, should be studied."

While the effects of poaching on many aspects of elephant social systems have been studied, the impacts on mating patterns are not yet understood and such information is still lacking in most African countries. In this study, we used elephant specific-microsatellite DNA to generate genotypes from 86 elephant samples (84 fresh faeces and two tissue samples) from Tarangire National Park (TNP), Tanzania to assess the mating success of individual males. We also tested whether the oldest bulls are more likely to sire most of the offspring in a severely poached population. Genetic paternity analysis was compared to behavioural observations of matings collected over a 3-year period (1998–2001) to determine the success of bull mating strategy. The genotypes of 26 infants, their known mothers and 10 out of 43 potential breeding bulls in TNP were used to assign 31% of the offspring at 80% confidence level to their potential fathers with simulation assuming that 23% (10/43) of the breeding males were sampled. Mating success of individual bull based on both behavioural and genetic data showed that the oldest remaining bulls performed most of the matings and fathered the majority of infants. We speculate that the lifetime fitness of bulls that have survived poaching may be elevated because their period of dominance increases."

Diagnosis is difficult because PM is often asymptomatic, peripheral blood smear examination detects parasitemia as few as half of PM cases, and no peripheral markers have been validated for placental inflammation. In a cohort of Tanzanian parturients, PM was determined by placental blood smears and placental inflammation was assessed by histology and TNF mRNA levels. Maternal peripheral blood levels of several immune mediators previously implicated in PM pathogenesis, as well as ferritin and leptin were measured. The relationship between the levels of these soluble factors to PM and placental inflammation was examined. Peripheral levels of TNF, TNF-RI, TNF-RII, IL-1, IL-10, and ferritin were elevated during PM, whereas levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6 were unchanged and levels of leptin were decreased. In receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, IL-10 had the greatest area under the curve, and would provide a sensitivity of 60% with a false positive rate of 10%. At a cut off level of 15 pg/mL, IL-10 would detect PM with a sensitivity of 79.5% and a specificity of 84.3%. IL-10 levels correlated with placental inflammatory cells and placental TNF mRNA levels in first time mothers. These data suggest that IL-10 may have utility as a biomarker for inflammatory PM in research studies, but that additional biomarkers may be required to improve clinical diagnosis and management of malaria during pregnancy."

In each region, the costing process was undertaken at different levels of health facilities in order to cater for any variations in the types and cost of the laboratory services delivered at each level. The total number of 53926 people took HIV related tests which is equivalent of about 6114 people in every laboratory per a year. The financial cost of HIV related test services of the capita assets is estimated at USD 58,000 while annual economic cost on HIV related test services is estimated at USD 9.4 M. It was also found that USD 16,900 was spent on training overall total of 88 staff. The total cost of laboratory supplies and consumables used for testing was USD 550,300 of which USD 504,000 were used on HIV related tests. Recurrent/variable cost claimed 95% of the total cost of delivering HIV test related services of which about 85% was spent on laboratory supplies and consumables while capital cost was only 5%. The findings show that in order to scale up HIV test services putting enough money for lab supplies and consumables is important. The main source of funding for buildings and staff time is the Government because HIV test services take place within the existing structure of health facility in Tanzania while lab equipment, lab supplies and lab consumables are funded mainly by non government agencies."

This cross sectional survey was carried out during June 2005 to determine the prevalence of malaria in an urban setting and compare microscopy diagnosis versus Paracheck Pf for detecting Plasmodium falciparum. Blood samples from a total of 301 children (< 10 years) attending outpatient clinic at Makorora Health Centre, in Tanga, Tanzania were examined for the presence of malaria. Twenty-nine (9.6%) of the children were positive to malaria by microscopy while 30 (10.0%) were positive by Paracheck test. Three out of 30 positive cases detected by Paracheck were negative by microscopy; thus considered to be false positive results. For the 271 Paracheck Pf negative cases, 2 were positive by microscopy; yielding 2 false negative results. Paracheck Pf sensitivity and specificity were 93.1% and 98.9%, respectively. P. falciparum was the only malarial species observed among the 29 microscopy positive cases. The prevalence of anaemia among the children was 53.16%. These findings indicate a low prevalence of malaria in Tanga City and that Paracheck Pf can be an effective tool for malaria diagnosis."

The mean age of the respondents was 33.2 years (range = 11-72 years). Forty-six (66.7%) of the patients had primary school education. Fifty-nine (84.1%) patients had good knowledge on the transmission of TB. Majority (75%) of the respondents were of the opinion that the incidence of TB was on the increase and this was mainly associated with HIV/AIDS epidemic. All respondents knew that TB was a curable disease if one complies with the treatment. Sixty-four (60%) respondents had good knowledge on the correct duration of tuberculosis treatment. The median duration before seeking treatment from a health facility was 1.5 months. The majority of the patients 47 (68%) visited public health facilities for treatment as their first action. Overall, 83.8% (57/68) respondents said females comply better with treatment than male patients. The majority of the respondents lived within a walking distance to a healthcare facility. Only 18.8% (13/69) had to spend an average of US$ 0.2-0.3 as travel costs to the healthcare facility. Most of the respondents (57.8%) said they were well attended by service providers. Half (21/42) and 59.3% (16/27) of the males and females, respectively, mentioned good patient-service provider relationship as an important reason for satisfaction of the service (chi2 = 0.57, df = 1, P > 0.005). Twenty-nine (42%) of respondents were of the opinion that female TB patients conformed better to treatment than males and a similar number thought that both of them equally conformed to treatment. Findings from this study indicate that a large population in urban settings are aware that health facilities play a major role in TB treatment. In conclusion, there is a need to further explore how this information could potentially be used to enhance early seeking of appropriate services among TB patients in the era of rapid urbanization. Strategies in the control of TB and other diseases should focus on advocacy in seeking appropriate care."

The current study investigates the knowledge of medical practitioners of zoonotic diseases as a potential contributing factor to their under-diagnosis and hence under-reporting. The study was designed as a cross-sectional survey. Semi-structured open-ended questionnaire was administered to medical practitioners to establish the knowledge of anthrax, rabies, brucellosis, trypanosomiasis, echinococcosis and bovine tuberculosis in selected health facilities within urban and rural settings in Tanzania between April and May 2005. Frequency data were analyzed using likelihood ratio chi-square in Minitab version 14 to compare practitioners' knowledge of transmission, clinical features and diagnosis of the zoonoses in the two settings. For each analysis, likelihood ratio chi-square p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. Fisher's exact test was used where expected results were less than five. Medical practitioners in rural health facilities had poor knowledge of transmission of sleeping sickness and clinical features of anthrax and rabies in humans compared to their urban counterparts. In both areas the practitioners had poor knowledge of how echinococcosis is transmitted to humans, clinical features of echinococcosis in humans, and diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in humans. Knowledge of medical practitioners of zoonotic diseases could be a contributing factor to their under-diagnosis and under-reporting in Tanzania. Refresher courses on zoonotic diseases should be conducted particularly to practitioners in rural areas. More emphasis should be put on zoonotic diseases in teaching curricula of medical practitioners' training institutions in Tanzania to improve the diagnosis, reporting and control of zoonotic diseases.

The essential oils of Ocimum suave and Ocimum kilimandscharicum were evaluated against malaria vectors in north-eastern Tanzania. An ethnobotanical study was conducted at Moshi in Kilimanjaro region north-eastern Tanzania, through interviews, to investigate the range of species of plants used as insect repellents. Also, bioassays were used to evaluate the protective potential of selected plants extracts against mosquitoes. The plant species mostly used as repellent at night are: fresh or smoke of the leaves of O. suave and O. kilimandscharicum (Lamiaceae), Azadirachta indica (Meliaceae), Eucalyptus globules (Myrtaceae) and Lantana camara (Verbenaceae). The most popular repellents were O. kilimandscharicum (OK) and O. suave (OS) used by 67% out of 120 households interviewed. Bioassay of essential oils of the two Ocimum plants was compared with citronella and DEET to study the repellence and feeding inhibition of untreated and treated arms of volunteers. Using filter papers impregnated with Ocimum extracts, knockdown effects and mortality was investigated on malaria mosquito Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles gambiae, including a nuisance mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus. High biting protection (83% to 91%) and feeding inhibition (71.2% to 92.5%) was observed against three species of mosquitoes. Likewise the extracts of Ocimum plants induced KD90 of longer time in mosquitoes than citronella, a standard botanical repellent. Mortality induced by standard dosage of 30 mg/m2 on filter papers, scored after 24 hours was 47.3% for OK and 57% for OS, compared with 67.7% for citronella. The use of whole plants and their products as insect repellents is common among village communities of north-eastern Tanzania and the results indicate that the use of O. suave and O. kilimandscharicum as a repellent would be beneficial in reducing vector biting. The widespread use of this approach has a potential to complement other control measures. "

Ocimum plant species, Ocimum suave (Willd) and O. kilimandscharicum (Guerke) materials and their essential oils extracted by steam distillation were evaluated in the field and experimental huts for repellence, exophily and feeding inhibition effects against three mosquito species, Anopheles arabiensis (Patton), An. gambiae ss (Giles) and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say). The protective effect of essential oils from Ocimum plants were compared with N, N-diethly-3- methylbenzamide (DEET), a standard synthetic repellent. Also, the protective effect of fumigation by burning of repellent plants; Ocimum suave, Ocimum kilimandscharicum , Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus globules and Lantana camara were tested in experimental huts and selected local houses. RESULTS: In the field, protection by Ocimum plants from mosquito bites was high and there was small variation among different mosquito species. Protection efficiency was 93.4%, 91.98% and 89.75% for An. arabiensis while for Cx. quinquefaciatus it was 91.30%, 88.65% and 90.50% for DEET, Ocimum suave and O. kilimandscharicum respectively. In the experimental hut, deterrence induced by burning of Ocimum and other plants ranged from 73.1.0% to 81.9% for An. arabiensis and 56.5% to 67.8% for Cx. quinquefaciatus, while feeding inhibition was 61.1% to 100% for An. arabiensis and 50% to 100% for Cx. quinquefaciatus. Evaluations under field conditions confirmed high protective efficacy, enhanced feeding inhibition and house entry inhibition (Deterrence). CONCLUSION: This study shows the potential of Ocimum suave and Ocimum kilimandscharicum crude extracts and whole plants of Ocimum suave, Ocimum kilimandscharicum, Azadirachta indica, Eucalyptus globules and Lantana camara for use in protecting against human biting while the burning of plants reduces significantly the indoor resting mosquitoes. "

Half of all new HIV infections occur in young people. Identification of the associated factors is likely to be useful in designing effective interventions. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the determinants of high-risk sexual behaviours among youths in Kibaha District, Tanzania. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The survey gathered data pertaining to the sexual healthy behaviours among youths, including condom use, number of sexual partners, age at first sexual involvement and knowledge on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS. A total of 322 individuals aged 15-24 years were involved in the study. More than 69% had sex at least once in their life time. Only about one-third (32.3%) of the youths reported to have used condom during the first sexual intercourse and 37% during the last sex. About 21.7% of the respondents acknowledged having more than one sexual partner in the last 12 months. The majority (98.4%) of the respondents have heard of HIV/AIDS. About three quarters (74.8%) of the respondents knew where to get HIV testing services but only a small proportion (28.9%) had tested for HIV infection. Of those not yet tested, 38.2% admitted that they were ready to do so. Although 317 (98.4%) respondents were aware of HIV/AIDS, and majority, 65.2% mentioned condom as the method used to prevent its transmission, only 117 (36.3%) acknowledged using them. In conclusion, despite good knowledge on transmission of HIV among youths in Kibaha district, only a small proportion of them practices safe sex. Education programmes on safe sex practices should be strengthened to provide skills that could be effective in changing and maintaining safe sex behaviours among youths in Tanzania."

It is estimated that about 500 million cases of malaria occur annually and among these 1 million die annually. Children below five years and pregnant women are the most vulnerable groups. Several malaria control measures have been applied such as environmental improvements, use of insecticide impregnated nets, residual indoor spraying, early case detection and treatment with effective antimalarial drugs. However, the adaptation of vector and parasite has so far limited the effect of these interventions. The emergence of resistance against drugs and insecticides requires in response a steady stream of new interventions. Up to the beginning of this millennium, most sub-Saharan African countries have been using chloroquine (CQ) as the first-line antimalarial drug, which had to be replaced with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) after resistant parasites had rendered CQ ineffective. Currently the first line treatment of malaria consists of combination therapy which includes an artemisinin derivative. The current approach appears robust but history has taught us to be alert and to expect resistance to emerge. There is a pressing need to develop and deploy complimentary strategies. Adding a protective vaccine to the existing control tools for malaria holds great promise yet no malaria vaccine has ever been licensed despite a large number of attempts. The complexity of malaria parasites and the ability of the parasite to suppress and evade immune responses are formidable challenges. Fortunately, there are several promising antimalarial vaccine candidates in the development pipeline. The most promising vaccine candidate is RTSS which is currently tested in various countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including two sites in Tanzania. There is a hope that malaria vaccines could be developed and deployed in malaria endemic communities. This article highlights the challenges of developing and deploying malaria vaccines."

Of the three brands of LLINs currently approved by WHO, Olyset(R) is the only one currently granted full recommendation. With this type of LLIN, the insecticide (permethrin) is incorporated into the polyethylene fibre during manufacture and diffuses from the core to the surface, thereby maintaining surface concentrations. It has not been determined for how long Olyset nets remain protective against mosquitoes in household use.          METHODS: Examples of Olyset nets, which had been in use in Tanzanian villages for seven years, were tested in experimental huts against naturally entering Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus mosquitoes. Performance was compared with new Olyset nets, conventionally treated ITNs (either newly treated with alphacypermethrin or taken from local villages after 1.5 years of use) and untreated nets. All nets were artificially holed except for the seven-year Olyset nets, which had developed holes during prolonged domestic use.          RESULTS: Anopheles funestus and An. gambiae in NE Tanzania are susceptible to pyrethroids. The new Olyset nets caused high mortality against An. funestus (73.9%) and An. gambiae (62.7%) in experimental huts. The seven-year Olyset nets caused 58.9% mortality against An. funestus and 40.0% mortality against An. gambiae. The freshly treated alphacypermethrin nets also caused high mortality against An. funestus (70.6%) and An. gambiae (72.0%); this decreased to 58.4% and 69.6% respectively after 1.5 years of use. The new Olyset nets inhibited blood-feeding by 40-50%. The 7 year Olyset nets showed no feeding inhibition over that shown by the untreated nets. The alphacypermethrin treated nets failed to inhibit blood-feeding after 1.5 years of use. However iHhhdn laboratory tunnel tests samples of all types of treated net including the 7 year Olyset inhibited blood-feeding by more than 95%CONCLUSION: After seven years of use Olyset nets were still strongly insecticidal. Mosquito mortality decreased by only 20-35% over this period. However, Olyset would not provide personal protection after seven years unless it was in good condition and all holes fully repaired."

The study assessed patient's satisfaction with the laboratory services where by a total of 295 patients were interviewed.                                                                                                                             Results: Of data analyzed for a varying totals from 224 to 294 patients, the percentage of dissatisfaction with both public and private laboratory services, ranged from 4.3% to 34.8%, with most of variables being more than 15%. Patients who sought private laboratory services were less dissatisfied with the cleanness (3/72, 4.2%) and the privacy (10/72, 13.9%) than those sought public laboratory service for the same services of cleanness (41/222, 18.5%) and privacy (61/222, 27.5%), and proportional differences were statistically significant (X2 = 8.7, p = 0.003 and X2 = 5.5, p = 0.01, respectively). Patients with higher education were more likely to be dissatisfied with privacy (OR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1–3.1) and waiting time (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.5 – 4.2) in both private and public facilities. Patients with secondary education were more likely to be dissatisfied with the waiting time (OR = 5.2; 95%CI: 2.2–12.2) and result notification (OR = 5.1 95%CI (2.2–12.2) than those with lower education.                                                                                                                                                                                           Conclusion: About 15.0% to 34.8% of patients were not satisfied with waiting time, privacy, results notification cleanness and timely instructions. Patients visited private facilities were less dissatisfied with cleanness and privacy of laboratory services than those visited public facilities. Patients with higher education were more likely to be dissatisfied with privacy and waiting time in both private and public facilities.

RESULTS: We interviewed 639 TB patients. A total of 78.4% of patients had good knowledge on TB transmission. Only 35.9% had good knowledge on the symptoms. Patient delay was observed in 35.1% of the patients, with significantly (X2 = 5.49, d.f. = 1, P = 0.019) high proportion in females (41.0%) than in males (31.5%). Diagnosis delay was observed in 52.9% of the patients, with significantly (X2 = 10.1, d.f. = 1, P = 0.001) high proportion in females (62.1%) than in males (47.0%). Treatment delay was observed in 34.4% of patients with no significant differences among males and females. Several risk factors were significantly associated with patient's delays in females but not in males. The factors included not recognizing the following as TB symptoms: night sweat (OR = 1.92, 95% CI 1.20, 3.05), chest pain (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.1, 2.37), weight loss (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.03, 2.32), and coughing blood (OR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.01, 2.16). Other factors included: living more than 5 Km from a health facility (OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.41, 3.55), no primary education (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.01, 3.05) and no employment (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.20, 2.60). In multiple logistic regression, five factors were more significant in females (OR = 2.22, 95% CI 1.14, 4.31) than in males (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.44, 1.11). These factors included not knowing that night sweat and chest pain are TB symptoms, a belief that TB is always associated with HIV infection, no employment and living far from a health facility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           CONCLUSION: There were significant delays in the management of TB patients which were contributed by both patients and health facilities. However, delays in most of patients were due to delay of diagnosis and treatment in health facilities. The delays at all levels were more common in females than males. This indicates the need for education targeting health seeking behaviour and improvement in health system."

The costs of eradication, managerial impediments to executing national control programmes, and scientific uncertainty about transmission endpoints, are challenges to the success of this effort, especially in areas of high endemicity where financial resources are limited. We used a combined analysis of empirical community data describing the association between infection and chronic disease prevalence, mathematical modelling, and economic analyses to identify and evaluate the feasibility of setting an infection target level at which the chronic pathology attributable to lymphatic filariasis - lymphoedema of the extremities and hydroceles - becomes negligible in the face of continuing transmission as a first stage option in achieving the elimination of this parasitic disease. The results show that microfilaria prevalences below a threshold of 3.55% at a blood sampling volume of 1 ml could constitute readily achievable and sustainable targets to control lymphatic filarial disease. They also show that as a result of the high marginal cost of curing the last few individuals to achieve elimination, maximal benefits can occur at this threshold. Indeed, a key finding from our coupled economic and epidemiological analysis is that when initial uncertainty regarding eradication occurs and prospects for resolving this uncertainty over time exist, it is economically beneficial to adopt a flexible, sequential, eradication strategy based on controlling chronic disease initially."

Maternal exposure to diseases such as malaria, HIV, and syphilis has been shown to have a significant impact on birth weight (BW). This study was aimed at determining whether there was a difference in rates of LBW in areas of varying malaria transmission intensity in Korogwe, Tanzania. Retrospective data for one year (June 2004-May 2005) in three maternal and child health (MCH) clinics in the district were analysed. Villages were stratified into three strata: lowlands-semi urban (average altitude of 320m), lowlands-rural (below 600m) and highlands (> or =600m). There was a significant decreasing trend of rate of LBW from rural lowlands to highlands (chi2trend = 7.335, P=0.007). Adjusting for covariates, women in parity-two were at reduced risk of delivering LBW babies compared to first parity women (OR=0.44, 95% CI 0.19-0.98, P=0.045). Similarly, the risk of LBW was higher in women who had delayed MCH gestational booking and in women who conceived during high malaria transmission seasons. There was high degree of preference of digits ending with 0/5 in reporting BW in the studied MCHs. In conclusion, a rate of LWB was high in rural lowlands where malaria is also endemic, and was associated with high malaria transmission seasons."

Mortality rates in C. quinquefasciatus were higher for chlorfenapyr than for deltamethrin. Despite a reputation for being slow acting, >90% of insecticide-induced mortality in laboratory tunnel tests and experimental huts occurred within 24 h, and the speed of killing was no slower than for deltamethrin-treated nets.        CONCLUSIONS: Chlorfenapyr induced low irritability and knockdown, which explains the relatively small reduction in blood-feeding rate. Combining chlorfenapyr with a more excito-repellent pyrethroid on bed nets for improved personal protection, control of pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes and pyrethroid resistance management would be advantageous."

Data collection took place between March 2005 and April 2007. The results show that although women and families do make efforts to prepare for childbirth, most home births are assisted by unskilled attendants, which contributes to a lack of immediate appropriate care for both mother and baby. The umbilical cord is thought to make the baby vulnerable to witchcraft and great care is taken to shield both mother and baby from bad spirits until the cord stump falls off. Some neonates are denied colostrum, which is perceived as dirty. Behaviour-change communication efforts are needed to improve early newborn care practices."

This anthropological work, designed to complement a large community-based project on stroke incidence, focuses on local understandings and treatment-seeking behaviours in urban (Dar-es-Salaam) and rural (Hai) areas of Tanzania. Semi-structured interviews (n=80) were conducted with 20 stroke patients, 20 relatives of stroke patients, ten traditional healers, and 30 other local residents. In contrast to common expectations, and literature that finds witchcraft beliefs to be most common in rural areas, stroke in urban Dar was widely believed to emanate from supernatural causes (demons and witchcraft), while in rural Hai, explanations drew mostly on 'natural' causes (hypertension, fatty foods, stress). These different beliefs and explanatory models fed into treatment-seeking behaviours. The first option in Hai was hospital treatment, while in Dar-es-Salaam, where belief in demons led to hospital avoidance, it was traditional healers. In both sites, multiple treatment options (serially or simultaneously) were the norm. Analysis of patient and carer narratives suggested that causation beliefs outweighed other factors, such as cost and distance, in shaping effective treatment. Three policy implications are drawn. First, as other studies have also shown, it is important to engage with, rather than dismiss, local explanations and interpretations of stroke. Stroke awareness messages need to take into account the geographical and belief systems differences. Developing an understanding of explanatory models that recognizes that local beliefs arise from dynamic processes of social interaction will be critical to designing effective interventions. Second, there is a clear role for multiple healing systems with possibility of cross-reference in the case of a chronic, disabling condition like stroke, since biomedical treatment cannot offer a 'quick fix' while traditional healers can help people come to terms with their condition. Third, issues of communication between health services and their patients are particularly critical."

METHODS: In-depth interviews were made with national level malaria control officers in 2006 and 2007. Data was analysed manually using a qualitative content analysis approach.   RESULTS: IPTp has been under implementation countrywide since 2001 and the 2005 evaluation report showed increased coverage of women taking two doses of IPTp from 29% to 65% between 2001 and 2007. This achievement was acknowledged, however, several challenges were noted including (i) the national antenatal care (ANC) guidelines emphasizing two IPTp doses during a woman's pregnancy, while other agencies operating at district level were recommending three doses, this confuses frontline health workers (HWs); (ii) focused ANC guidelines have been revised, but printing and distribution to districts has often been delayed; (iii) reports from district management teams demonstrate constraints related to women's late booking, understaffing, inadequate skills of most HWs and their poor motivation. Other problems were unreliable supply of free SP at private clinics, clean and safe water shortage at many government ANC clinics limiting direct observation treatment and occasionally pregnant women asked to pay for ANC services. Finally, supervision of peripheral health facilities has been inadequate and national guidelines on district budgeting for health services have been inflexible. IPTp coverage is generally low partly because IPTp is not systematically enforced like programmes on immunization, tuberculosis, leprosy and other infectious diseases. Necessary concerted efforts towards fostering uptake and coverage of two IPTp doses were emphasized by the national level officers, who called for further action including operational health systems research to understand challenges and suggest ways forward for effective implementation and high coverage of IPTp.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              CONCLUSION: The benefit of IPTp is appreciated by national level officers who are encouraged by trends in the coverage of IPTp doses. However, their appeal for concerted efforts towards IPTp scaling-up through rectifying the systemic constraints and operational research is important and supported by suggestions by other authors.

Vast biomedical literature on malaria prevention focuses more on the epidemiological and cost-effectiveness analyses of the randomised controlled trials carried out in selected geographical settings. Such studies fail to elucidate the economic, psychosocial, managerial, organization and other contextual systemic factors influencing the operational effectiveness, compliance and coverage of the recommended interventions.                                                                                                                                                        Objective: To review literature on policy advances, achievements, constraints and challenges to malaria IPTp implementation, emphasising on its operational feasibility in the context of health-care financing, provision and uptake, resource constraints and psychosocial factors in Africa.                                                                                                                                          Results: The importance of IPTp in preventing unnecessary anaemia, morbidity and mortality in pregnancy and improving childbirth outcomes is highly acknowledged, although the following factors appear to be the main constraints to IPTp service delivery and uptake: cost of accessing ANC; myths and other discriminatory socio-cultural values on pregnancy; target users, perceptions and attitudes towards SP, malaria, and quality of ANC; supply and cost of SP at health facilities; understaffing and demoralised staff; ambiguity and impracticability of user-fee exemption policy guidelines on essential ANC services; implementing IPTp, bednets, HIV and syphilis screening programmes in the same clinic settings; and reports on increasing parasite resistant to SP. However, the noted increase in the coverage of the delivery of IPTp doses in several countries justify that IPTp implementation is possible and better than not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Conclusion: IPTp for malaria is implemented in constrained conditions in Africa. This is a challenge for higher coverage of at least two doses and attainment of the Abuja targets. Yet, there are opportunities for addressing the existing challenges, and one of the useful options is the evaluation of the acceptability and viability of the existing intervention guidelines."

We hypothesized that fetal genes that modify PM would be associated with fetal fitness. During PM, placental trophoblasts produce soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt1), also known as soluble VEGF receptor 1, an angiogenesis inhibitor associated with preeclampsia. Here we present a study examining the genotype of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) 3? UTR in Tanzanian mother–infant pairs. First-time mothers suffer the most PM, and newborn FLT1 genotype distribution differed by birth order, with newborns of first-time mothers outside of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) during peak PM season. Among first-time but not other mothers, maternal FLT1 genotype was associated with a history of prior pregnancy loss. During PM, newborn FLT1 genotype was associated with low birth weight and placental inflammatory gene expression. FLT1 genotype was also associated with Flt1 levels among study subjects and in vitro. Thus, FLT1 variants confer fetal fitness in utero and are associated with the maternal immune response during PM. This indicates that FLT1 is under natural selection in a malaria endemic area and that human exposure to malaria can influence the evolutionary genetics of the maternal-fetal relationship."

As evidence grows on the efficacy of IPTi as public health strategy, information is needed so that this novel control tool can be put into practice promptly, once a policy recommendation is made to implement it. This paper describes the development of a behaviour change communication strategy to support implementation of IPTi by the routine health services in southern Tanzania, in the context of a five-year research programme evaluating the community effectiveness of IPTi. Mixed methods including a rapid qualitative assessment and quantitative health facility survey were used to investigate communities' and providers' knowledge and practices relating to malaria, EPI, sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and existing health posters. Results were applied to develop an appropriate behaviour change communication strategy for IPTi involving personal communication between mothers and health staff, supported by a brand name and two posters. Malaria in young children was considered to be a nuisance because it causes sleepless nights. Vaccination services were well accepted and their use was considered the mother's responsibility. Babies were generally taken for vaccination despite complaints about fevers and swellings after the injections. Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine was widely used for malaria treatment and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, despite widespread rumours of adverse reactions based on hearsay and newspaper reports. Almost all health providers said that they or their spouse were ready to take SP in pregnancy (96%, 223/242). A brand name, key messages and images were developed and pre-tested as behaviour change communication materials. The posters contained public health messages, which explained the intervention itself, how and when children receive it and safety issues. Implementation of IPTi started in January 2005 and evaluation is ongoing. Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) strategies for health interventions must be both culturally appropriate and technically sound. A mixed methods approach can facilitate an interactive process among relevant actors to develop a BCC strategy."

Studies have revealed the extent to which individuals are stigmatized and discriminated against the health care system. However, there has been limited information on stigma manifestations and reduction interventions. The main objective of the study was to determine the magnitude and factors influencing HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination with a specific focus on the manifestations and reduction interventions. In-depth interviews, exit interviews and focus group discussions were deployed in the study. Results have shown that HIV/AIDS is increasingly conceptualized as a continuum between prevention and care, effects of stigma and discrimination are from both health facilities and communities. While religious leaders isolate people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) and consider them as most promiscuous, health workers also have strong negative attitudes and feelings and as a result PLWHAs refrain from counselling and testing services. A stigmatizing social environment was found to pose barriers to all strategies and/or interventions that are aimed at reducing this situation. Because of stigma and discrimination, people living with HIV/AIDS receive inadequate treatment, as such they decline to divulge their status to partners or change their behaviour avoiding depressing reactions. Basing on that therefore, adequate outreach services at both community and health facility levels be established and line up in the fight against stigma and discrimination facing people living with HIV/AIDS."

Methods: This was a cross sectional hospital and community based survey, from 1st of May to 31st of August in Amana hospital and its catchment area in Ilala district Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Results: A total of 68 smear positive index cases were recruited in the passive case finding period whereby 390 of their household contacts were interviewed. Twenty out of the 390 (5.1%) contacts interviewed in the passive case finding period, reported to have cough which had lasted for two weeks or more at the day of the household visit. None of their symptomatic household contacts had been diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of the household interviews. A total of 74 smear positive index cases were recruited in the active case finding whereby 425 of their household contacts were interviewed. Eighteen out of 425 (4.2%) contacts reported to have had cough which lasted for two weeks or more. One of the two contacts was smear positive tuberculosis and one was smear negative. Overall, two contacts were diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis in the active case finding. This is a standardized prevalence of 471/100?000 (95% CI 82/100?000, 1879/100?000). Since the prevalence of TB by passive case finding was zero, the prevalence odds was undefined with an insignificant P-value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Conclusion: Due to the relatively low prevalence of tuberculosis it would be virtually impossible to interpret case detection findings based on statistical significances. Nevertheless, this study indicated that strengthening the current passive case finding system coupled with the introduction of active case finding, targeted to household contacts of infectious TB patients is likely to detect more tuberculosis cases than passive case finding alon"

Understanding of the method of parasite acquisition is important for estimating the time incidence of congenital malaria and design of preventive measures. The aim of this study was to determine whether the first Plasmodium falciparum malaria disease in infants is due to same parasites present on the placenta at birth. Babies born to mothers with P. falciparum parasites on the placenta detected by PCR were followed up to two years and observed for malaria episodes. Paired placental and infant peripheral blood samples at first malaria episode within first three months of life were genotyped (msp2) to determine genetic relatedness. Selected amplifications from nested PCR were sequenced and compared between pairs. Eighteen (19.1%) out of 95 infants who were followed up developed clinical malaria within the first three months of age. Eight pairs (60%) out of 14 pairs of sequenced placental and cord samples were genetically related while six (40%) were genetically unrelated. One pair (14.3%) out of seven pairs of sequenced placental and infants samples were genetically related. In addition, infants born from primigravidae mothers were more likely to be infected with P. falciparum (P < 0.001) as compared to infants from secundigravidae and multigravidae mothers during the two years of follow up. Infants from multigravidae mothers got the first P. falciparum infection earlier than those from secundigravidae and primigravidae mothers (RR = 1.43). Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites present on the placenta as detected by PCR are more likely to result in clinical disease (congenital malaria) in the infant during the first three months of life. However, sequencing data seem to question the validity of this likelihood. Therefore, the relationship between placental parasites and first clinical disease need to be confirmed in larger studies"

The objective was to determine the factors that may have contributed to the relatively stable pattern of the HIV prevalence observed in the comparison communities of the Mwanza STD treatment trial in rural Mwanza Region, Tanzania between 1991 and 2001. Socio-demographic, sexual behaviour and HIV prevalence data in two surveys conducted 10 years apart in the same communities using similar sampling schemes were compared. The age standardised HIV prevalence was 3.8% (95% CI: 3.2-4.6) in 1991 and 4.3% (95% CI: 2.8-6.4) in 2001 for males (Z= - 0.56, P= 0.58); and 4.5% (95% CI: 3.8-5.3) in 1991 and 3.9% (95% CI: 2.6-5.6) in 2001 for females (Z= 0.64, P = 0.52). Participants in the 2001 survey reported significantly fewer lifetime and recent sexual partners (12 months), Sexually Transmitted disease syndromes (12 months) and significantly more condom use at last sex with casual partners than those in the 1991 behaviour survey. We conclude that STD/HIV infection prevention activities in rural Mwanza may be responsible for changes in risky sexual behaviour and have successfully impeded the spread of HIV infection. These activities should therefore be enhanced to reduce HIV incidence even further. In addition, modelling studies are needed to assess whether mobility of HIV infected people out of rural communities may stabilise the prevalence of the HIV infection in the general populations."

We aimed to ascertain whether hospital nurses in a district hospital could conduct paediatric examinations as reliably as clinical staff, when provided with a short structured training session. Hospital nurses (HN), hospital clinical officers (HCO) and research clinical officers (RCO) repeated examinations on children admitted to the paediatric ward shortly after the first examination by an RCO. Kappa scores were used to compare the agreement on the presence or absence of basic clinical signs by different categories of staff. Among 439 paired examinations the agreement between RCOs on clinical signs was slightly higher than for HCOs or HNs; the mean (median) Kappa scores for all signs examined were 0.54 (0.57) for RCO-RCO, 0.49 (0.49) for RCO-HCO and 0.50 (0.49) for RCO-HN. Levels of agreement were lower if children were under the age of 18 months or if they cried during the examination. Nurses with basic training appear to perform as well as clinically trained staff in eliciting essential signs in acutely ill children. Their role in the initial and ongoing assessment of these children should be reviewed in light of the critical shortages in clinically trained staff in African hospitals."

To address the extent of the tuberculosis HIV coinfection in rural Tanzania we conducted a cross sectional study including HIV/AIDS patients attending care and treatment clinic from September 2006 to March 2007. Methods Sputum samples were collected for microscopy, culture and drug susceptibility testing. Chest X-ray was done for those patients who consented. Blood samples were collected for CD4+ T cells count. Results The prevalence of tuberculosis was 20/233 (8.5%). Twenty (8.5%) sputum samples were culture positive. Eight of the culture positive samples (40%) were smear positive. Fifteen (75%) of these patients neither had clinical symptoms nor chest X-ray findings suggestive of tuberculosis. Nineteen isolates (95%) were susceptible to rifampicin, isoniazid, streptomycin and ethambutol (the first line tuberculosis drugs). One isolate (5%) from HIV/tuberculosis coinfected patients was resistant to isoniazid. No cases of multi- drug resistant tuberculosis were identified. Conclusion We found high prevalence of tuberculosis disease in this setting. Chest radiograph suggestive of tuberculosis and clinical symptoms of fever and cough were uncommon findings in HIV/tuberculosis coinfected patients. Tuberculosis can occur at any stage of CD4+T cells depletion."

However, sensitivities of tests in routine use are unsatisfactory, due to the characteristically low parasitaemias in naturally infected individuals. We have identified a conserved sequence in the repetitive insertion mobile element (RIME) of the sub-genus Trypanozoon and used it to design primers for a highly specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test. The test was used to analyse Trypanozoon isolates and clinical samples from HAT patients. The RIME LAMP assay was performed at 62 C using real-time PCR and a water bath. DNA amplification was detectable within 25 min. All positive samples detected by gel electrophoresis or in real-time using SYTO-9 fluorescence dye could also be detected visually by addition of SYBR Green I to the product. The amplicon was unequivocally confirmed through restriction enzyme NdeI digestion, analysis of melt curves and sequencing. The analytical sensitivity of the RIME LAMP assay was equivalent to 0.001 trypanosomes/ml while that of classical PCR tests ranged from 0.1 to 1000 trypanosomes/ml. LAMP detected all 75 Trypanozoon isolates while TBR1 and two primers (specific for sub-genus Trypanozoon) showed a sensitivity of 86.9%. The SRA gene PCR detected 21 out of 40 Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense isolates while Trypanosoma gambiense-specific glycoprotein primers (TgsGP) detected 11 out of 13 T. b. gambiense isolates. Using clinical samples, the LAMP test detected parasite DNA in 18 out of 20 samples which included using supernatant prepared from boiled blood, CSF and direct native serum. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the LAMP assay coupled with the ability to detect the results visually without the need for sophisticated equipment indicate that the technique has strong potential for detection of HAT in clinical settings. Since the LAMP test shows a high tolerance to different biological substances, determination of the appropriate protocols for processing the template to make it a user-friendly technique, prior to large scale evaluation, is needed. 2007 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Most informants opposed abortion as illegal, immoral, dangerous, or unacceptable without the man's consent, and many reported that ancestral spirits killed women who aborted clan descendants. Nonetheless, abortion was widely, if infrequently, attempted, by ingestion of laundry detergent, chloroquine, ashes, and specific herbs. Most women who attempted abortion were young, single, and desperate. Some succeeded, but they experienced opposition from sexual partners, sexual exploitation by practitioners, serious health problems, social ostracism, and quasi-legal sanctions. Many informants reported the belief that inopportune pregnancies could be suspended for months or years using traditional medicine.

Villages were stratified by immunization coverage. Data were transcribed and analysed using NVivo7 software. results Communities’ knowledge of malaria aetiology and diagnosis was good, although generally villagers did not seek treatment at health centres as their first choice. Perceptions and attitudes towards IPTi were very positive among communities and health workers. A misconception that SP was an antipyretic that prevents post-vaccinal fever contributed to IPTi’s acceptability. No refusals or negative rumours related to IPTi coupling with immunizations were identified, and IPTi did not negatively influence attitudes towards other malaria control strategies. Healthcare decisions about children, normatively made by the father, are starting to shift to educated and financially independent mothers. discussion Intermittent preventive treatment in infants is well accepted by providers and communities, showing a synergic acceptability when coupled with routine immunizations.

The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of parenteral artemisinin derivatives versus parenteral quinine in treating severe malaria in children.                                                                                                  Methods: All randomized controlled studies comparing parenteral artemisinin derivatives with parenteral quinine in treating severe malaria in children were included in the review. Data bases searched were: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2008), EMBASE (1980 to February 2008), and LILACS (1982 to February 2008). Dichotomous variables were compared using risk ratios (RR) and the continuous data using weighted mean difference (WMD).                         Results: Twelve trials were included (1,524 subjects). There was no difference in mortality between artemisinin derivatives and quinine (RR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.12). The artemisinin derivatives resolved coma faster than quinine (WMD = -4.61, 95% CI: -7.21 to -2.00, fixed effect model), but when trials with adequate concealment only were considered this differences disappeared. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in parasite clearance time, fever clearance time, incidence of neurological sequelae and 28th day cure rate.

Objective: To determine factors associated with smear negative and culture positive results. Methods: Pulmonary tuberculosis patients were consecutively recruited for 12 months from five health facilities in Mwanza region, Tanzania. Sputum examinations were done at the recruitment centre and at the TB reference laboratory using Auramine O technique. Culture was done at the TB reference laboratory using Lowenstein Jensen solid media. A post-hoc analysis compared patients who had a smear negative culture positive result (case) with patients who had not (controls). Results: A total of 655 pulmonary TB patients were recruited, 18 had no culture results and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 637 patients, 127 (19.9%) had three negative smears at the recruitment centre and 34 patients were a case. Current smoking was strongly associated with being a case, especially in women. Of the 127 patients who had three negative smears at the recruitment center, 104 (81.9%) also had a negative smear at the reference laboratory. Of these, 13 (12.5%) were still culture positive. Conclusion: The frequencies of smear-negative culture-positive results differ between health facilities, indicating possible difference in quality of laboratory procedures. Strengthening of laboratory capacity is needed both for optimizing smear microscopy techniques, and for performing sputum cultures for diagnosing TB when there is a high rate of suspicion. The association between smoking and smear negative culture positive TB needs to be assessed in adequately large studies."

Typanosoma brucei rhodesiense were detected in both the blood and CSF samples. The patient was treated successfully with melarsoprol. The results of this case study highlight the possibility of resurgence of sleeping sickness in the park hence calls for the need to create more awareness among the community and clinicians. There is need for early reporting to health facility and strengthening the diagnostic capacity of healthcare facilities in and around national parks endemic for sleeping sickness."

The results indicate that, 191 (90.5%, n = 211) individuals knew tsetse flies and 187 (88.6%, n = 211) knew HAT. All nine key informants reported that, the communities were aware of HAT while seven key informants reported that, the communities were aware of health risks associated with tsetse bites in human. There was poor knowledge about the role played by animals in the transmission of HAT (26.7%, n = 187). Majority of those who knew HAT (n = 187) were willing to contribute labour (70.1%) and money (64.2%) to tsetse and HAT control whereas amongst those who knew tsetse flies, 66.5% and 60.7% were willing to contribute labour and money, respectively. Amongst those who knew any HAT control technique (n = 108), 78.7% and 82.4% were willing to contribute money and labour respectively.

The objective was to determine factors associated with LBW and their contribution to the problem. Out of 648 pregnant women who were tested for HIV infection 59 (9.1%) were positive for the infection. Twelve (20.3%) of HIV positive women gave birth to LBW neonates. HIV positive women were twice more likely to give birth to LBW infants than HIV negative ones (?2 = 6.7; P< 0.01).

The perceived link between health and development has been articulated in much of the policy and academic literature resulting in many initiatives to introduce integrated health information systems at the local level. Despite huge investments made in this direction, these systems have not made any radical impact on the delivery of healthcare for local communities. Drawing on empirical work in Tanzania, we argue that this has been because of the adoption of a narrow, managerialist perspective of “integration”. We propose instead an interpretation of integration from a variety of standpoints; development studies, management, and sociology. According to this approach, it is not just data that is integrated, but ways of working and the social relations which support the health information systems at global, national and local levels. In our discussion section, we broaden the scope of integrated health information systems to consider the integration of not just management information but also epidemiological data."

Eighty five percent of school pupils who participated in the study reported to have been taught about AIDS and less than 30% on sex and pregnancy. Sixty three percent of study participants were of the opinion that a girl or woman should not refuse to have sex after being given a gift, and having sex with an elder partner was thought to be acceptable by almost fifty percent of participants.

Most schoolboys and about 50% of schoolgirls reported to have experienced sex by the time of the study. Thirty eight percent of girls reported to have first sex at the age of 14 years. Nine percent of the participants who reported to have experienced sex were forced to do so. Knowledge regarding STDs and HIV/AIDS was high among participants, but a sizeable proportion report misconception on transmission of STDs/HIV such as through sharing a towel and insect bites.

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) with specificity for VSA (anti-VSA IgG) is therefore considered important for acquired immunity. To better understand the nature and dynamics of variant-specific IgG responses at population level, we conducted an immunoepidemiological study in nearby communities in northeastern Tanzania, situated at different altitudes and therefore exposed to different levels of P. falciparum transmission intensity. Samples of plasma and infected red blood cells (IRBC) were collected from 759 individuals aged 0 to 19 years. Plasma levels of IgG with specificity for VSA expressed by a panel of different parasite isolates were measured by flow cytometry, while the ability of plasma to inhibit IRBC adhesion to CD36 was examined in cellular assays. The level and repertoire of the heterologous anti-VSA IgG response developed dramatically in individuals at 1 to 2 years of age in the high-transmission area, reaching a maximum level at around 10 years of age; only a modest further increase was observed among older children and adults. In contrast, at lower levels of malaria transmission, anti-VSA IgG levels were lower and the repertoire was more narrow, and similar age- and transmission-dependent differences were observed with regard to the ability of the plasma samples to inhibit adhesion of IRBC to CD36. These differences indicate a strong and dynamic relationship between malaria exposure and functional characteristics of the variant-specific antibody response, which is likely to be important for protection against malaria"

METHODS: Survey and in-depth interview (IDI) data from adolescents enrolled in a community randomized sexual health intervention trial in rural Mwanza, Tanzania were analysed.   RESULTS: The 5354 male school attenders (median age 15.5 years) were recruited in 1998 and followed for 3 years. At baseline, circumcision prevalence was 13.7% by self-report and 11.8% by clinical examination, rising to 17.3% by clinical examination at final survey. Only 61.5% of Muslim males were circumcised at the final survey. Of 506 participants who reported being circumcised at baseline, only 78.9% reported this at interim. Similarly, only 84.2% of participants clinically assessed as circumcised at baseline were also assessed as circumcised at interim. At both baseline and interim surveys, about 80% of participants who reported being circumcised were also found to be so at clinical examination. There was a high tolerance and respect for circumcision among male IDI respondents, with widespread belief that it was beneficial for penile hygiene and disease prevention. The majority of female IDI respondents said that they did not know what male circumcision was.

This paper reports on the efforts to determine whether adequate records could be found to enable a compliance study. A step-down process from project to district to community level was used to identify project sites where continuous ivermectin distribution up through 2004 had occurred. The first step consisted of selecting 17 of 25 projects by APOC. The second step determined adequacy of districts where distribution had occurred on a regular annual basis. Among 121 districts 58.6% undertook distribution in all 7 years. A total 852 villages were visited and community level records were found in all but three. Records showed that distribution had occurred for a minimum of five consecutive times in 429 villages, and ultimately 10 projects. While the feasibility study found an adequate number of villages to study compliance, the large number of projects, districts and villages that did not qualify for the follow-on compliance study should lead National Onchocerciasis Control Programme managers to strengthen the overall coverage and consistency of their efforts."

Malaria Journal 6:67.",Haemoglobin and haematocrit: is the threefold conversion valid for assessing anaemia in malaria-endemic settings?, malaria,Malaria Journal,2007,6,,67,,5,,,,,,,,,"Background: Anaemic status is determined by haemoglobin using the HemoCue system or haematocrit measurements, and a threefold conversion is commonly used to equate the two measures (haemoglobin = haematocrit/3). The validity of this conversion in malaria endemic settings was assessed.                                                                                                                         Methods: Concurrent measures of haemoglobin and centrifuged haematocrit in children aged 6–59 months were compared by modelling the difference between the two measures against their average. A random effects linear regression of the difference of the measures on their average was used to describe the line of best agreement and 95% limits of agreement for these two measures over a range of values after adjusting for statistically significant covariates.                                                                                                                                                                Results: There was a consistent bias between the two measures, with haemoglobin less than haematocrit/3 in 87% (899/1,030) of observations. This difference was non-uniform, decreasing with the average measure, i.e. less difference at higher haemoglobin and haematocrit values. In these studies, use of haematocrit would have underestimated the prevalence of anaemia by misclassifying 10% (89/920) of individuals with haemoglobin < 11 g/dl, 66% (252/380) of individuals with haemoglobin < 8 g/dl and 100% (23/23) of individuals with haemoglobin < 5 g/dl. The mean difference between the measures was greater in males than females, increased with age between 6–59 months, and was greater in the wet than dry season suggesting that the relationship between haemoglobin and haematocrit may be modified by exposure to malaria.                                                                                                                Conclusion:The regression model indicated that the standard threefold conversion from haematocrit to haemoglobin underestimates the prevalence of haemoglobin < 11 g/dl in children under five years of age in malaria endemic settings. This bias was more acute for more severe anaemia defined by haemoglobin < 8 g/dl and haemoglobin < 5 g/dl. This has important implications for the comparability of studies using these different measures. Direct determination of haemoglobin should be the measurement of choice for assessing anaemia outcomes in malaria intervention trials and surveys.

We assessed, in a blinded comparison with HIV serum testing, the sensitivity and specificity of the OraQuick® assay for detecting HIV antibody in sputum specimens kept at ambient temperature for up to 7 days, with and without decontaminant. Methods: Paired sputum and blood specimens from consecutively diagnosed smear-positive tuberculosis patients were tested with OraQuick® and 2 HIV-1/2 ELISA's. Sputum was tested within 24 hours of collection, split into 2 aliquots with and without addition of cetylpyridium chloride, and tested again after 4 and 7 days. Results: Complete data was available for 377/435 (87%) enrolled patients; 132 (35%) tested HIV positive on serum. The sensitivity of the sputum test was 94.7% (95% CI 89.4–97.8) on day 1, 93.2% on day 4 and 92.9% on day 7. The specificity was 92.9% (95% CI 88.9–95.8) on day 1, and declined to 76.7% on day 4 (p < 0.001) and to 62.7% on day 7 (p < 0.001). Adding cetylpyridium chloride further decreased the specificity to 67.8% on day 4 (p = 0.04) and to 49.6% on day 7 (p = 0.004). Conclusion: Transportation of sputum specimens at ambient temperatures for 4 days or more, and addition of decontaminant, strongly affect the specificity of the OraQuick® assay. Unless applied within one day, this assay is not suitable for estimation of HIV-prevalence among tuberculosis patients in survey settings."

The carriage rate of ?+-thalassemia decreased by ~12% per 100-m increase in altitude ( P < .001 ) and was ~50% lower among those with patent parasitemia than among uninfected individuals (P = .014 ). The prevalence of the sickle cell trait was lower than that of ?+-thalassemia (range, 0%-14%) and was significantly associated with village altitude only ( P = .011 ).

PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases 1 (1), e67.", National mass drug administration costs for lymphatic filariasis elimination,lymphatic filariasis,PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases ,2007,1,1,e67,,22,,,,,,,,,"Background: Because lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination efforts are hampered by a dearth of economic information about the cost of mass drug administration (MDA) programs (using either albendazole with diethylcarbamazine [DEC] or albendazole with ivermectin), a multicenter study was undertaken to determine the costs of MDA programs to interrupt transmission of infection with LF. Such results are particularly important because LF programs have the necessary diagnostic and treatment tools to eliminate the disease as a public health problem globally, and already by 2006, the Global Programme to Eliminate LF had initiated treatment programs covering over 400 million of the 1.3 billion people at risk.           Methodology/Principal Findings: To obtain annual costs to carry out the MDA strategy, researchers from seven countries developed and followed a common cost analysis protocol designed to estimate 1) the total annual cost of the LF program, 2) the average cost per person treated, and 3) the relative contributions of the endemic countries and the external partners. Costs per person treated ranged from $0.06 to $2.23. Principal reasons for the variation were 1) the age (newness) of the MDA program, 2) the use of volunteers, and 3) the size of the population treated. Substantial contributions by governments were documented – generally 60%–90% of program operation costs, excluding costs of donated medications  Conclusions/Significance: MDA for LF elimination is comparatively inexpensive in relation to most other public health programs. Governments and communities make the predominant financial contributions to actual MDA implementation, not counting the cost of the drugs themselves. The results highlight the impact of the use of volunteers on program costs and provide specific cost data for 7 different countries that can be used as a basis both for modifying current programs and for developing new ones."

A key question remaining is the extent to which the disappointing performance of current tests is associated with a high background prevalence of latent TB.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Methods: We compared Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific ESAT-6 and CFP-10 antibody responses in a total of 565 human serum samples from M. tuberculosis-uninfected donors and donors with latent infection, as well as samples from patients with active TB. Our study included samples from 4 countries, representing environments with low, intermediate, and high TB incidences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Results: We demonstrated significant increases in antibody levels in latently infected contacts, compared with M. tuberculosis-uninfected individuals, and in patients with active TB disease, compared with latently infected contacts. Furthermore, we found a striking increase in the magnitude of the antibody responses in samples obtained from infected Ethiopian individuals (with and without disease), compared with Danish and Brazilian infected individuals; this was presumably the result of higher exposure levels.                                                     Conclusions. Our study confirms the presence of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 antibodies in patients with TB, and we demonstrate that significant antibody responses are not restricted to active TB disease but can reflect latent infection, particularly in areas with high levels of exposure to M. tuberculosis. This finding is important for the understanding of the poor discriminatory power of current serodiagnostic tests in regions of endemicity, and it may have major implications on the future development of serologic tests.

Molecular markers of parasite resistance suitable for surveillance have not been established for any of the component drugs in either of these combinations. We assessed P. falciparum mdr1 (Pfmdr1) alleles present in 300 Tanzanian children presenting with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, who were enrolled in a clinical trial of antimalarial therapy. Pfmdr1 genotype analysis was also performed with isolates from 182 children who failed AQ monotherapy and 54 children who failed AL treatment. Pfmdr1 alleles 86Y, 184Y, and 1246Y were more common among treatment failures in the AQ group than among pretreatment infections. The converse was found in the AL-treated group. Children presenting with the 86Y/184Y/1246Y Pfmdr1 haplotype and treated with AQ were significantly more likely to retain this haplotype if they were parasite positive during posttreatment follow-up than were children treated with AL (odds ratio, 33.25; 95% confidence interval, 4.17 to 1441; P, <0.001). We conclude that AL and AQ exert opposite within-host selective effects on the Pfmdr1 gene of P. falciparum."

However, female representation in the committees was low (15.2%). The largest proportion of the committee members was biomedical scientists (51.5%).

Committee members had different capacities to carry out review of research proposals (no capacity = 2%; limited capacity = 15%; moderate capacity = 20%; good capacity = 48%, excellent capacity = 13%). Only half of the respondents had prior ethics review training. Although the majority deemed that ethical guidelines were very important (66%), there were challenges in the use of ethical guidelines which included lack of awareness on the national accreditation mechanisms for ethics committee (59%). Adherence to ethical principles and regulations was influenced by being a scientist (OR = 42.47), being an employee of a professional organization (OR = 15.25), and having an interests in the use of ethical guidelines (OR = 10.85) These findings indicate the need for capacity strengthening (through training and resource support), inclusion of more female representation and other mandatory professions to the research ethics committees."

Few studies have followed seroconverters for 10 or more years to describe such patterns.                                                                                                                       METHODS: The Kisesa open cohort study conducted four rounds of village-based HIV testing and 20 rounds of household-based demographic surveillance between 1994 and 2006. Approximate infection dates were established for individual seroconverters by allocating a date between the last negative and first positive test. Person-years lived post-infection were computed, allowing for left truncation and right censoring, and Kaplan-Meier survival functions were constructed, truncating the analysis at the start of 2005 when ART first became available in the community. Weibull models were fitted to estimate median survival time, and parametric regression methods were used to investigate the influence of sex and age at infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RESULTS: A total of 369 seroconverters were identified, providing 890 person-years of follow-up during which 44 deaths were observed. The Kaplan-Meier function showed 67% surviving 9 years post-infection, and the overall predicted median survival was 11.5 years. Survival was strongly related to age at infection (hazard ratio 1.06 for each additional year of age, and weakly to sex. A strong effect of age was evident even after allowing for mortality from non-HIV-related causes using cause deletion methods to estimate net mortality.     CONCLUSION: The survival of HIV-infected individuals was comparable to that reported in developed country studies before the introduction of HAART. Survival patterns in Kisesa are marginally more favourable than those reported in cohort studies in Uganda."

The worm intensities were higher and exhibited a nonlinear age pattern in a high-transmission community, Masaika, in contrast to the low but linearly increasing age infection profile observed for a low-transmission community, Kingwede. The mean levels of specific immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), IgG2, IgG4, and IgE were also higher in Masaika, but intriguingly, the IgG3 response was higher in Kingwede. The age-antibody patterns differed in the two communities but in a manner apparently contrary to a role in acquired immunity when the data were assessed using simple correlation methods. By contrast, multivariate analyses showed that the antibody response to infection may be classified into three types and that two of these types, a IgG3-type response and a response measuring a trade-off in host production of IgG4 and IgG3 versus production of IgG1, IgG2, and IgE, had a negative effect on Wuchereria circulating antigen levels in a manner that supported a role for these responses in the generation of acquired immunity to infection. Mathematical modeling supported the conclusions drawn from empirical data analyses that variations in both transmission and worm intensity can explain community differences in the age profiles and impacts of these antibody response types. This study showed that parasite-specific antibody responses may be associated with the generation of acquired immunity to human filarial infection but in a form which is dependent on worm transmission intensity and interactions between immune components."

PfEMP1 molecules can be divided into groups A, B/A, B, C, and B/C. We have previously suggested that expression of groups A and B/A PfEMP1 is associated with severe disease and that Abs to these molecules are acquired earlier in life than Abs to PfEMP1 belonging to groups B, B/C, and C PfEMP1. In this study, we compared the acquisition of IgG to 20 rPfEMP1 domains derived from 3D7 in individuals living under markedly different malaria transmission intensity and were unable to find differences in the Ab acquisition rate to PfEMP1 of different groupings (A, B, or C) or domain type (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, or x). Abs were acquired early in life in individuals living in the high transmission village and by the age of 2-4 years most individuals had Abs against most constructs. This level of reactivity was found at the age of 10-20 years in the medium transmission village and was never reached by individuals living under low transmission. Nevertheless, the sequence by which individuals acquired Abs to particular constructs was largely the same in the three villages. This indicates that the pattern of PfEMP1 expression by parasites transmitted at the different sites was similar, suggesting that PfEMP1 expression is nonrandom and shaped by host-parasite relationship factors operating at all transmission intensities."

Susceptibility tests of mature larvae of Simulium damnosum s.l. vectors to temephos insecticide were carried out before and after two years of insecticide treatment of rivers within Tukuyu onchocerciasis focus, south-western Tanzania. The tests were done in 1999/2000 and 2004 using WHO standard methods. Mature larvae were exposed to 9 concentrations of temephos active ingredient, from the weakest 0.00975mg/litre to the strongest of 2.5mg/l. Each test concentration and control was run in duplicates of 25 larvae each, set for three hours in a cool temperature. After incubation, test solution was discarded and larval condition checked. Numbers of larvae in each category were recorded and used to determine mortality rate for each concentration as well as for the LC50 and LC95. A total of 1,666 larvae were tested, 942 during the pre- and 724 post-treatment. Results showed that both pre and post-treatment samples were susceptible, attaining 100% mortality at the diagnostic dose of 1.25mg/l, and LC50 between 0.129-0.34mg/l pre - and 0.144-0.211 mg/l (95% CI, P < 0.05) post- treatment. These values fall within the standard diagnostic dose of < or = 0.4mg/l for susceptible S. damnosum s.l populations.

Temephos was thus recommended for continued use in onchocerciasis vector control in the Tukuyu focus, to complement Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin, but close monitoring of vector susceptibility should be done."

Verbal autopsies (VA) are used to determine the underlying cause of death, and the probable diagnosis helps to estimate reasonably cause-specific mortality. In this paper, we report findings of a verbal autopsy survey which involved eight villages in both low and highlands of Muheza district, north-eastern Tanzania. The survey was conducted following a rapid census, which was done to identify households that had lost one or more members within a period of two years from the date of census. Trained research assistants administered VA questionnaires to parents/close relatives. Two physicians reviewed each report independently and a third opinion was sought where there was discordant report between the two. A total of 9,872 households were surveyed and 134 deaths were recorded. A total of 96 (71.6%) deaths were from lowland villages representing high malaria transmission. Majority (72.4%) of the reported deaths occurred at home whilst 32.1% occurred at heath facility settings. Overall, severe malaria was the leading cause accounting for 34.3% of all deaths. Infants were most affected and accounted for 43.5% of the total deaths. Pulmonary tuberculosis ranked second (8.2%) cause of deaths and was exclusively confined to individuals > or = 15 years. Probable cause of death could not be determined in 13.4% of deaths. In conclusion, majority of deaths in rural north-eastern Tanzania occur at home and the immediate causes are usually unknown or not documented. These findings indicate that the verbal autopsy is a useful tool for detecting leading causes of death at community level in the absence of health facility-based data."

The continued presence of plague in this focus warrants further studies. Nonetheless, our findings provide a platform for development of an epidemic preparedness plan to contain future outbreaks."

Twenty-six T. b. rhodesiense isolates and two references T. b. rhodesiense isolates from Kenya were examined for SRA gene using simple Polymerase Chain Reaction technique. The gene was found to be present in all 26 T. b. rhodesiense isolates including the two references isolates from Kenya. The SRA gene was confirmed to be specific to T. b. rhodesiense since it could not be amplified from all other Trypanozoon including T. b. gambiense; and gave an amplified fragment of the expected size (3.9kb), confirming that all these isolates were T. b. rhodesiense of the northern variant. Although the geographic distributions of T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense are clearly localized to west/central Africa and eastern Africa, respectively, natural movement of people and recent influx of large number of refugees into Tanzania from the Democratic Republic of Congo, could have brought T. b. gambiense in western Tanzania. The overlap in distribution of both of these pathogenic sub-species could result in erroneous diagnoses since both trypanosome sub-species are morphologically identical, and currently serologic methods have low specificity. Both the susceptible and resistant T. b. rhodesiense isolates possessed the SRA gene suggesting that there is no correlation between drug resistance and presence of SRA gene. The use of SRA gene helps to confirm the identity and diversity of some of the isolates resistant to various drugs."

The aim of this study was to test out a model for priority setting which incorporates both scientific evidence and public values, and to explore use of evidence by a selection of stakeholders and to study reasons for the relative ranking of health care interventions in a setting of extreme resource scarcity. Systematic search for and assessment of relevant evidence for priority setting in a low-income country. Development of a balance sheet according to Eddy's explicit method. Eight group interviews (n-85), using a modified nominal group technique for eliciting individual and group rankings of a given set of health interventions. The study procedure made it possible to compare the groups' ranking before and after all the evidence was provided to participants. A rank deviation is significant if the rank order of the same intervention differed by two or more points on the ordinal scale. A comparison between the initial rank and the final rank (before deliberation) showed a rank deviation of 67%. The difference between the initial rank and the final rank after discussion and voting gave a rank deviation of 78%. Evidence-based and deliberative decision-making does change priorities significantly in an experimental setting. Our use of the balance sheet method was meant as a demonstration project, but could if properly developed be feasible for health planners, experts and health workers, although more work is needed before it can be used for laypersons."

The disease causes major obstacles to social and economic development. The extent of the problem is greatest among children less than five years of age and pregnant women. Malaria has been estimated to cost Tanzania more than US$ 240 million every year in lost gross domestic product, although it can be controlled for a fraction of that sum. Tanzania has actively participated in malaria research and in developing most control tools. However, the use of such tools and scaling up of effective interventions has been a major challenge. Major system constraints include inadequate human, financial, material resources, as well as an inefficient health care system. With an increasing burden with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), there has been a shift in the use of resources whereby more prioritization is given to interventions for HIV/AIDS than for malaria. The country is faced with several challenges including diagnosis, treatment, and control measures. Districts are faced with the inability to generate reliable information needed to make decisions to inform policy and lack skills for priority setting and planning. Budget allocation is not done according to evidence-based priorities, thus leading to stagnation over time. In this report, we present some success stories and discuss the challenges facing scaling up of interventions and propose priority areas to solving the problems"

The study investigated Glossina species composition, trap density, trypanosome infection rates, and the diversity of trypanosomes infecting the species. Tsetse were trapped using monopyramidal traps in the mornings between 06:00 to 11:00 and transported to the veterinary laboratory in Serengeti National Park where they were sorted into species and sex, and dissected microscopically to determine trypanosome infection rates. Age estimation of dissected flies was also conducted concurrently. Tsetse samples positive for trypanosomes were subjected to PCR to determine the identity of the detected trypanosomes. Out of 2,519 tsetse trapped, 1,522 (60.42%) were G. swynnertoni, 993 (39.42%) were G. pallidipes, three (0.12%) were G. m. morsitans, and one (0.04%) was G. brevipalpis. The trap density for G. swynnertoni was between 1.40 and 14.17 while that of G. pallidipes was between 0.23 and 9.70. Out of 677 dissected G. swynnertoni, 63 flies (9.3%) were infected, of which 62 (98.4%) were females. A total of 199 G. pallidipes was also dissected but none was infected. There was no significant difference between the apparent densities of G. swynnertoni compared to that of G. pallidipes (t = 1.42, p = 0.18). Molecular characterization of the 63 infected G. swynnertoni midguts showed that 19 (30.2%) were trypanosomes associated with suid animals while nine (14.3%) were trypanosomes associated with bovid animals and five samples (7.9%) had T. brucei s.l genomic DNA. Thirty (47.6%) tsetse samples could not be identified. Subsequent PCR to differentiate between T. b. brucei and T. b. rhodesiense showed that all five samples that contained the T. brucei s.l genomic DNA were positive for the SRA molecular marker indicating that they were T. b. rhodesiense. These results indicate that G. swynnertoni plays a major role in the transmission of trypaniosomiasis in the area and that deliberate and sustainable control measures should be initiated and scaled up."

We conducted a cross-sectional study among adults around Lake Victoria to describe iron status and asses the role of dietary and infectious predictors. Linear regression analyses were used to assess the role of infections and intake of meat, fish, fruit/vegetables, alcoholic beverages, and soil on hemoglobin and serum ferritin, while controlling for elevated serum alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT). Among 1498 participants, the mean age was 33.3 (14-87) y with 53.9% females. More than one-half ate fish daily, 6% ate fruit/vegetables daily, and only 11% ate meat weekly. One-third consumed alcoholic beverages and one-fifth of females consumed soil. Hookworm (80.3%), Schistosoma mansoni (64.7%), and HIV (7.3%) infection were common. Anemia was found in 48.2% of females (<120 g/L hemoglobin) and 40.1% of males (<130 g/L hemoglobin), and 22.3% of females and 7.0% of males had depleted iron stores (serum ferritin <12 microg/L). In multivariate analyses, alcoholic beverage consumption and HIV were positive, whereas soil eating and hookworm infection were negative predictors of serum ferritin. Alcoholic beverage consumption was a positive predictor of hemoglobin, and soil eating, HIV, and hookworm infection were negative predictors. Intakes of meat, fish, and fruit or vegetables were not predictors. Elevated serum ACT was a predictor of both hemoglobin and serum ferritin. Anemia and depleted iron stores were common, whereas iron overload was rare. In conclusion, the associations between alcoholic beverage intake and hemoglobin and iron status suggest that alcoholic beverages may contain micronutrients essential to erythropoiesis. The role of alcoholic beverage intake and other determinants of hemoglobin and iron status in low-income populations needs to be better elucidated."

Correct knowledge and positive perception of the community towards TB and its management is a prerequisite to early treatment seeking. This study was carried out in Mpwapwa district, central Tanzania, to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practice as regards to TB and its treatment. Focus group discussions involving men and women were conducted in six villages. Results show that TB was an important public health problem. However, community knowledge on its cause was poor. Symptoms of TB as mentioned by the community included persistent cough and weight loss. TB was reported to be transmitted mainly through air. Self medication was the first most preferred option, whereas health care facility consultation was the last one. Focus group discussants knew that TB cure requires a 8-month period of treatment. Friends and relatives were the main source of TB information in the community. In conclusion, rural communities of Mpwapwa District have a low knowledge on the causes and the transmission of tuberculosis which is a likely cause of the delay in seeking treatment. An intensive appropriate community health education is required for a positive behavioural change in tuberculosis control. ("

This will involve screening a large number of people, which will require non-laboratory personnel to be involved in doing HIV testing. In order to guarantee reliable and quality HIV test results, there is a need to ensure that quality assurance (QA) procedures are followed from specimen collection, testing and reporting of results. In light of the above a survey was conducted to assess QA in HIV testing in health facilities in Lake Victoria zone, Tanzania. A total of 89 health facilities (29 hospitals, 34 health centres, 9 dispensaries and 17 voluntary and counselling testing centres) were surveyed. Only three (10.3%) health facilities reported performing Uniform II ELISA for HIV diagnosis. All other health facilities reported to be using HIV rapid tests Capillus and Determine. Five (5.6%) of health facility laboratories performed CD4 counts. Internal quality control (IQC) were performed in 21 (63.6%) of the hospitals. Kits for HIV testing were reported to be readily available by 54 (60.7%) of the facilities. Only 16 (18%) of the health facilities had standard operating procedures in place. Systems of equipment calibration were reported by 13 (14.6%) of the health facilities. Counselling services were available in all health facilities and all counsellors had received the 6-week mandatory training course. These findings show that most of health facilities in the Lake Victoria zone do not adhere to QA procedures in HIV testing. There is therefore, a need to establish a monitoring system to laboratories performing HIV testing for the purpose of ensuring QA procedures are done. Personnel doing HIV testing should be re-trained at a regular basis to cope with new techniques and ensure QA procedures are followed."

This village has had a recent re-introduction of cattle dipping for tick control. A total of 32 livestock keepers were interviewed using structured pre-tested questionnaire and data on human fly-related eye and diarrhoeal infections from five-year (2001 -2005) patient records from Kambala dispensary were obtained. Results showed that there was 39% drop in eye infections from 2003 to 2004 concomitant with increase in dipping following rehabilitation of the village livestock dip tank and start of dipping cattle in synthetic pyrethroid acaricide. Fly population density in homesteads with livestock dipped in the synthetic pyrethroid was lower than in those homesteads where animals were sprayed with acaricide from the diamidine group. Both Musca sorbens andMusca domestica were identified in the study area and fly annoyance was observed in both cattle and man although children infested with face flies appeared more fly-tolerant than adults. The study revealed that 76.7% of households had two to five members who had encountered eye infection but there was no statistically significant difference between young and adults who once had eye infections (p>0.05). A relationship between eye infection, weather condition and high fly population density was revealed in the questionnaire study. It is concluded that strategic dipping in synthetic pyrethroids can reduce fly annoyance and eye infections. In contrast to the eye-related infections which appeared to decrease following dipping, diarrhoeal diseases (likely associated with the house fly (Musca domestica), were on the ascendance from year to year with only a slight decrease between year 2003 and 2004."

Efforts made during the past century to combat and control malaria have not been successful. The prospects of achieving the Abuja declaration targets are uncertain within the remaining period of time. Currently, the Ministry of Health through a 5-year strategic plan advocates four main approaches in the fight against the disease. These include improved case management, vector control using insecticide treated mosquito nets, prevention and control of malaria in pregnancy and epidemic preparedness, prevention and control. However, these strategies face various challenges including inadequate human, financial, and material resources; inefficiency in the healthcare system that is incapable of providing quality health services and access to prompt diagnosis and treatment; lack of an effective disease surveillance system; and an inefficient health education communication mechanism. Tanzania is at the crossroads and is challenged with the need to introduce a new antimalarial treatment regimen and the reintroduction of DDT for indoor residual spray. Unless malaria control strategy adopts an integrated approach its success is far from being realized. This article reviews the current malaria control strategies and its challenges in Tanzania and proposes new strategies."

We investigated the role of domestic animals as possible reservoirs of infection in a TBRF endemic region. Tick infestations in households and pigpens were investigated in the villages near Mvumi hospital in central Tanzania. Blood from chickens and pigs was examined by PCR and flagellin gene sequencing was performed on any Borrelia sp. infections detected. A mark-recapture experiment investigated tick movement between pigpens and houses. The acceptability of chickens as tick hosts was also investigated. Tick infestation of the 122 houses investigated was high (47%). Pigpens also were tick infested (16%) and were more likely to be so if they were located close to tick infested households (p<0.001). PCR screening of peripheral blood found Borrelia infections in both chickens and pigs (11% and 8.9% respectively). Sequencing of a subset of positive samples revealed that the amplified Borrelia sp. flagellin gene fragments shared greatest homology with B. duttonii. In a mark-recapture experiment, ticks released in pigpens were recaptured inside human bedrooms. When offered chickens as hosts, over 20% of ticks fed. For the first time in East Africa, we record natural infections of Borrelia in domestic animals and show that tick populations may act as bridging vectors between animals and humans. These results, from villages where B. duttonii is already known to be prevalent and a major cause of illness in humans, and where it has been found at high levels in ticks, strongly support the case that it is a zoonosis. This increases understanding of the epidemiology and control of this important but neglected human disease."

If a management action is prescribed, monitoring plays a pivotal role in assessing the effectiveness of implemented actions, identifying necessary adaptations for management and determining when management objectives are achieved. Here, we focus on the control of the vector-borne parasitic disease, lymphatic filariasis, to show how mathematical models of parasite transmission can provide a scientific framework for supporting the optimal design of parasite control monitoring programmes by their ability to (1) enable the estimation of endpoint targets, (2) provide information on expected trends in infection due to interventions to allow rational evaluation of intervention effectiveness and calculation of the frequency of monitoring, (3) support the selection of indicators that permit reliable and statistically powerful measurement of the effects of interventions while minimizing costs and sampling intensity and (4) aid the interpretation of monitoring data for improving programme management and knowledge of the population dynamics of parasite control. The results also highlight how the use of a model-based monitoring framework will be vitally enhanced by adopting an adaptive management approach that acknowledges uncertainty and facilitates the use of monitoring data to learn about effective control, and which allows future decisions to be modified as we learn by doing. We conclude by emphasizing a pressing need to incorporate mathematical models coupled with changes to existing management systems in ongoing efforts to design and implement rational monitoring plans for evaluating filariasis and other parasitic disease control programmes."

This study combines an understanding of gender issues relating to health and help-seeking behaviour with epidemiological knowledge concerning place of delivery. In-depth interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation were used to explore determinants of home delivery in southern Tanzania. Quantitative data were collected in a cross-sectional survey of 21,600 randomly chosen households. Issues of risk and vulnerability, such as lack of money, lack of transport, sudden onset of labour, short labour, staff attitudes, lack of privacy, tradition and cultures and the pattern of decision-making power within the household were perceived as key determinants of the place of delivery. More than 9000 women were interviewed about their most recent delivery in the quantitative survey. There were substantial variations between ethnic groups with respect to place of delivery (P<0.0001). Women who lived in male-headed households were less likely to deliver in a health facility than women in female-headed households (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.91). Mothers with primary and higher education were more likely to deliver at a health facility (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.23-1.38). Younger mothers and the least poor women were also more likely to deliver in a health facility compared with the older and the poorest women, respectively. To address neonatal mortality, special attention should be paid to neonatal health in both maternal and child health programmes. The findings emphasize the need for a systematic approach to overcome health-system constraints, community based programmes and scale-up effective low-cost interventions which are already available."

Respondents at village and ward levels in both districts related HSR with a cost sharing system at public health facilities. Views on the advantages or disadvantages of HSR were mixed, most of the residents pointing out that user charges burden the poor, there is a shortage of drugs at peripheral health facilities, the performance of government health service staff and village health workers does not satisfy community needs, health insurance is promoted more than people actually benefit, VDC and WDC poorly function as compared to local community-participatory priority-setting structures. HSR may not meet the desired health needs unless more efforts are made to enhance the performance of the existing HSR structures and community knowledge and enhance trust and participation in the health sector programmes at all levels."

The objective was to assess contemporary Onchocerciasis clinical and parasitological situation and assess community knowledge about the disease and its control. From historical data, five villages with high parasite prevalence were selected, two each on the Lufilyo and Kiwira Rivers and one on lower Lumbira River. Skin biopsies were taken from the iliac crest on the left and right buttocks, for examination of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae. Onchocercal skin lesions were checked using natural light, while nodules were palpated from head to ankles and scored. A structured questionnaire was administered to participants. A total of 438 persons (age=16-99 years) were examined. No skin microfilariae (mf) were detected. Onchocercal skin symptoms were found in 170 (38.8%), of which 30 (6.9%) had nodules, 48 (11.0%) chronic onchodermatitis and 92 (21%) itching. One-third (34.5%) had correct knowledge that black flies (""tusunya"") are vectors of onchocerciasis. Half of the respondents (n=217) confirmed taking ivermectin for onchocerciasis treatment, and 428 (97.7%) were willing to continue for any duration. It is concluded that the undetectable skin microfilariae in the study sample was partly attributable to the consequences of ongoing ivermectin mass treatment. It is recommended that the control efforts, as well as monitoring and evaluation be sustained to determine its long term impact, and that a more sensitive technique be used to check O. volvulus skin mf prevalence."

Thus, there was no clear evidence for an interaction between HIV and W. bancrofti infection. A multiple linear regression model showed that the presence of CFA was strongly positively associated with specific TNF response and, similarly, that HIV-positive individuals had higher TNF responses than HIV-negative individuals. Interestingly, the CD4% and CD4/CD8 ratio were higher in HIV-positive individuals with hookworms than in those without hookworm co-infection.

HIV load and CD4% both increased, although not statistically significantly, in the HIV-positive individuals without filarial infection. The findings suggest that DEC affected HIV load through its effect on the filarial infection rather than through a direct (pharmacodynamic) effect on HIV. Global efforts to control lymphatic filariasis by annual mass treatment with DEC may have a beneficial effect on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in areas where HIV and lymphatic filariasis co-exist."

Many studies have been carried out on the prevalence of the disease in cattle but very little has been done in small ruminants. In Tanzania several reports have been written on livestock diseases in the country, but with very little attention to diseases of small ruminants. The study was undertaken in goats in selected farms in Morogoro, Tanzania, between June and August 2006. The aim was to establish the prevalence rate of trypanosomosis in naturally infected goats and to determine awareness of livestock keepers on the factors contributing to the existence and magnitude of the infection. The methods used included administration of a pre-tested questionnaire to 28 farmers and laboratory diagnosis using thick and thin blood smears as well as buffy coat for the examination of the blood. A total of 243 goats were sampled, but none of the goats were found to be parasitologically positive for trypanosomosis. The absence of trypanosomes in goats may be due to the control methods used, which included both anti-trypanocidal drugs use and tsetse control. The questionnaire administered to the livestock keepers revealed that most of the livestock keepers in the study area were adults with primary education level with most of them keeping goats and some combining with cattle at the flock size range between 11-20 animals. The major problems hindering livestock production in the study area included water and land scarcity, conflict between livestock keepers and diseases of which the major ones according to them were worm infestation and trypanosomosis. The disease control regime in the area included deworming using Milsan® and Albendazole and prophylaxis using Samorin®at the intervals of three months. A new disease control regime should be /designed in the area to control the disease effectively after having the correct data for production, management, prophylaxis and treatment. This will be obtained through developing proper recording system, laboratory diagnosis, and deployment of traps to establish existence of tsetse in the area."

Process evaluation included observation of training sessions, monitoring and supervision, annual surveys of implementers, group discussions and 158 person-weeks of participant observation. Most teachers taught curriculum content well, but sometimes had difficulty adopting new teaching styles. Peer educators performed scripted dramas well, but were limited as informal educators and behavioural models. The intervention appeared successful in addressing some cognitions, e.g. knowledge of risks and benefits of behaviours, but not others, e.g. perceived susceptibility to risk. MkV shared the characteristics of other African school-based programmes found to be successful, and similarly found significant improvements in self-reported behaviour in surveys. However, a substantial proportion of MkV survey self-reports were inconsistent, there was no consistent impact on biological markers and extensive process evaluation found little impact on several key theoretical determinants of behaviour. Improvements in self-reported survey data alone may provide only a very limited-and perhaps invalid-indication of adolescent sexual health programme success."

Results are grouped into three key areas: surveillance reporting, use of surveillance data and management of the IDSR system. In general, reporting systems are weak, both in terms of receiving all reports from all facilities in a timely manner, and in managing those reports at the district level. Routine analysis of surveillance data is not being done at facility or district levels, and districts do not monitor the performance of their surveillance system. There was also good communication and coordination with other sectors in terms of sharing information and resources. It is important that districts' capacity on IDSR is strengthened to enable them monitor and evaluate their own performance using established indicators."

Vector mosquitoes were collected in light traps set up in 50 randomly selected households once weekly for 1 year. They were identified, dissected and checked for filarial larvae. Vector densities and transmission potentials varied markedly between households, both for all vectors combined and for the individual vector species (Anopheles gambiae s.1., An. funestus and Culex quinquefasciatus), even between households located close to each other. The variation in vector abundance was probably mainly attributable to differences in the distance to breeding sites, to specific household features likely to ease mosquito entry and hiding, and to the number of household inhabitants. Household annual biting rates (ABR) correlated positively with household annual transmission potentials (ATP), indicating that intense vector biting led to a high transmission intensity. Intriguingly, however, the human filarial-infection status (as indicated by microfilaraemia or circulating filarial antigenemia) did not differ significantly between households with relatively high and lower ABR or ATP. Possible reasons for this result include the long time required for W. bancrofti infection to establish in humans, human behaviour affecting exposure, the sharing of mosquito populations between households, and differential susceptibility of humans to infection. The marked heterogeneity in exposure between households, and the lack of immediate relationship between transmission and detectable human infection at household level, should be taken into account when considering the transmission pattern of lymphatic filariasis."

In samples from 86 patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria from Mbeya and Matema, Mbeya region, south-western Tanzania, the occurrence of mutations was investigated in the pfcrt and pfmdr1 genes which are associated with CQ resistance and in pfdhfr and pfdhps, conferring SP resistance, as well in cytb which is linked to resistance to atovaquone.

We investigated whether polymorphisms in the candidate genes encoding solute carrier 11a1 protein (SLC11A1 formerly NRAMP1), mannose-binding lectin (MBL2) and Vitamin D receptor (VDR) were associated with tuberculosis in an East-African setting. Four hundred and forty-three culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 426 controls from Mwanza district in the northern part of Tanzania were prospectively included. Polymorphisms in the candidate genes were detected by different PCR-based techniques. A significant association between pulmonary tuberculosis and a microsatellite marker in the 5'(CA)n locus in the SLC11A1 gene compared with controls (38% versus 30% odds ratio 1.45, 95% CI: 1.06-1.9, P=0.014) was observed. The association was apparent only in HIV negative tuberculosis patients. No association with tuberculosis was seen with 3 other SLC11A1 loci investigated, which previously have been associated with tuberculosis in other populations or with MBL2 and VDR polymorphisms. The tuberculosis associated microsatellite marker was situated on different SLC11A1 haplotypes. In this cohort a microsatellite marker in the 5'(CA)n locus situated in the SLC11A1 gene was associated with tuberculosis. The observed association was seen only in HIV negative patients suggesting that this genetic susceptibility for tuberculosis may be surpassed by co-infections."

Bacteriological cultures were done at the National Institute for Medical Research laboratory. A total of 489 patients (median age = 20 years) participated in the study and were able to provide stool specimens. Shigella species were isolated from 14% (69/489) of the stool specimens collected. Of the sixty nine strains of Shigella spp isolated, 62 (90%) were S. flexneri and 7 (10%) were S. dysenteriae. All Shigella strains isolated showed high resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and chloramphenicol, drugs commonly used for management of shigellosis in Tanzania. However all isolates were fully susceptible to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, erythromycin, cefuroxime and gentamycin. S. flexneri showed resistance to amoxy-clavulanic_acid and azithromycin in 5% and 2% of isolates, respectively. None of the S. dysenteriae isolates were resistant to these two drugs. Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia and Schistosoma mansoni were microscopically detected in 16.5%, 4.4% and 5.3% of patients, respectively. These findings suggest that there is a need to carry out extensive susceptibility studies in different parts of the country with view of re-appraising the current guidelines for management of bloody diarrhoea in Tanzania."

Wards were divided into seventy-eight geographical clusters, representatives at cluster and ward level elected and a city-level Community Advisory Committee (CAC) with representatives from each ward established. Workshops and community meetings at ward and city-level were conducted to explore project-related concerns using tools adapted from participatory learning and action techniques such as listing, scoring, ranking, chapatti diagrams and pair-wise matrices.

Data from an open cohort in northern Tanzania provide robust estimates of prevalence and incidence. Between 1994 and 2004, 19 rounds of household-based demographic surveillance and 4 rounds of individually linked HIV serologic surveys were conducted. Longitudinal knowledge of individuals' testing histories is used to allow for effects of selective participation on prevalence estimates; multiple imputation procedures allow for interval censoring effects on incidence. A total of 16,820 adults donated blood for HIV testing in at least 1 of 4 serologic surveys. HIV prevalence increased steadily from 6.0% in 1994/1995 to 8.3% in 2000/2001, leveling out thereafter. HIV incidence increased sharply from 0.8% in 1994 to 1997 to 1.2% per thousand in 1997 to 2000, remaining high (1.1%) in 2000 to 2003. In roadside areas, incidence fell in the last interval, especially among women, but in remote rural areas, incidence rose slightly. HIV spread is continuing in rural areas, suggesting a need for more intensive HIV prevention efforts and antiretroviral interventions. The leveling off in prevalence is attributable to a combination of high mortality among HIV-infected persons and a slight decrease in incidence in roadside villages."

METHODS: 1688 women who attended for antenatal care were recruited into a prospective study of the effectiveness of syphilis screening and treatment. All women were screened and treated for syphilis and other reproductive tract infections (RTIs) during pregnancy and followed to delivery to measure the incidence of stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), low birth weight (LBW) and preterm live birth. FINDINGS: At delivery, 2.7% of 1536 women experienced a stillbirth, 12% of live births were preterm and 8% were LBW. Stillbirth was independently associated with a past history of stillbirth, short maternal stature and anaemia. LBW was associated with short maternal stature, ethnicity, occupation, gravidity and maternal malaria whereas preterm birth was associated with occupation, age of sexual debut, untreated bacterial vaginosis and maternal malaria. IUGR was associated with gravidity, maternal malaria, short stature, and delivering a female infant. In the women who had been screened and treated for syphilis, in between 20 and 34% of women with each outcome was estimated to be attributable to malaria, and 63% of stillbirths were estimated as being attributable to maternal anaemia. Screening and treatment of RTIs was effective and no association was seen between treated RTIs and adverse pregnancy outcomes. CONCLUSION: Maternal malaria and anaemia continue to be significant causes of adverse pregnancy outcome in sub-Saharan Africa. Providing reproductive health services that include treatment of RTIs and prevention of malaria and maternal anaemia to reduce adverse birth outcomes remains a priority."

Spoligotyping is a potentially powerful genotyping method due to fast generation of genotyping results, high reproducibility and low operation costs. The recently constructed SpolDB4 database and the model-based program 'Spotclust' can be used to assign isolates to families, subfamilies and variants. The results of a study can thus be analyzed in a global context. One hundred forty-seven pulmonary isolates from consecutive tuberculosis patients in Dar es Salaam were spoligotyped. SpolDB4 and 'Spotclust' were used to assign isolates to families, subfamilies and variants. The CAS (37%), LAM (22%) and EAI (17%) families were the most abundant. Despite the dominance of these three families, diversity was high due to variation within M. tuberculosis families. Of the obtained spoligopatterns, 64% were previously unrecorded.

Women become resistant to malaria during pregnancy as they acquire antibodies that inhibit parasite adhesion to CSA, suggesting that a vaccine against placental malaria is feasible. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and non-immune IgG have also been proposed as receptors for P. falciparum adhesion in the placenta, but evidence for their roles is inconclusive. In this study, CSA, HA, and IgG were simultaneously assessed for their relative contributions to placental adhesion. Placental parasites collected in Tanzania uniformly adhered to the molecule CSA, and soluble CSA completely inhibited adhesion of most samples to placental cryosections. Three of 46 placental parasite samples also adhered to immobilized HA, but HA failed to inhibit adhesion of any placental parasites to placental cryosections. Similarly, non-immune IgG and protein A failed to inhibit adhesion of parasite samples to placental cryosection. P. falciparum adhesion in the placenta appears to be a non-redundant process that requires CSA as a receptor. Vaccines that elicit functional antibodies against CSA-binding parasites may confer resistance to pregnancy malaria."

In the high endemicity community, intensities of the measured antibodies were significantly associated with infection status. IgG1, IgG2, and IgE were negatively associated with microfilaria (MF) status, IgG3 was negatively associated with circulating filarial antigen (CFA) status, and IgG4 was positively associated with CFA status. None of the associations were significantly influenced by chronic lymphatic disease status. In contrast, IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4 responses were less vigorous in the low endemicity community and, except for IgG4, did not show any significant associations with MF or CFA status. The IgG3 responses were considerably more vigorous in the low endemicity community than in the high endemicity one. Only IgG4 responses exhibited a rather similar pattern in the two communities, being significantly positively associated with CFA status in both communities. The IgG4:IgE ratios were higher in infection-positive individuals than in infection-negative ones, and higher in the high endemicity community than in the low endemicity one. Overall, these results indicate that specific antibody responses in Bancroftian filariasis are more related to infection status than to chronic lymphatic disease status. They also suggest that community transmission intensity play a dominant but subtle role in shaping the observed response patterns."

Expression of category A molecules is associated with severe malaria, and that of category non-A molecules is associated with uncomplicated malaria and asymptomatic infection. Here we assessed cross-reactivity among 60 different recombinant PfEMP1 domains derived from clone 3D7 by using a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a pool of plasma from 63 malaria-exposed Tanzanian individuals.

The majority of the respondents reported high fever (98.7%) and prostration (53.7%) as major symptoms of severe malaria. Convulsions were associated with high fever by only 13.7% of the respondents. Forty percent of the respondents attributed convulsions in children to either fever or malaria, and 24.4% correctly mentioned high fever or malaria. A health facility was the first point of care for childhood malaria for the majority (73%) of the respondents. In diarrhoeal diseases, prostration-weakness (67.7%) and dysentery (20.4%) were commonly reported among the respondents. Typical symptoms of severe dehydration (sunken eyes, loss of skin turgor, dry tears) were poorly recognised as characteristics of severe diarrhoeal diseases. Over 85% of the respondents practiced appropriate dietary measures or increased fluid intake for a child who had diarrhoea. Use of anti-diarrhoea (40.8%) and antibiotic medications (34.8%) were common in the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases.

For in vivo testing, doses higher than those in the initial screening test were used. Two T. b rhodesiense stocks expressed resistance in vivo to melarsoprol at 5 mg/kg and at 10 mg/kg. These strains had high IC(50) and MIC values consistent with those of the melarsoprol-resistant reference strain. Another isolate relapsed after treatment with 5 mg/kg of melarsoprol although it did not appear resistant in vitro. One isolate was resistant to diminazene at 14 mg/kg and another was resistant at both 14 and 28 mg/kg of diminazene. These two isolates had high IC(50) values consistent with the diminazene-resistant reference strain. Two isolates relapsed at a dose of 5 mg/kg of suramin, although no isolate appeared resistant in the in vitro tests.

People were considered short-term mobile if they had slept outside the household at least once on the night before one of the five demographic interviews, and long-term mobile if they were living elsewhere at least once at the time of a demographic round. Overall, whereas long-term mobile men did not report more risk behavior than resident men, short-term mobile men reported having multiple sex partners in the last year significantly more often. In contrast, long-term mobile women reported having multiple sex partners more often than resident women (6.8 versus 2.4%; P = 0.001), and also had a higher HIV prevalence (7.7 versus 2.7%; P = 0.02). In couples, men and women who were resident and had a long-term mobile partner both reported more sexual risk behavior and also showed higher HIV prevalence than people with resident/short-term mobile partners. Remarkably, risk behavior of men increased more when their wives moved than when they were mobile themselves. More sexual risk behavior and an increased risk of HIV infection were seen not only in mobile persons, but also in partners staying behind. Interventions aiming at reducing risk behavior due to mobility should therefore include partners staying behind."

Monitoring of insecticide resistance in vector populations is an important component of current malaria control programmes. Knockdown resistance (kdr) confers resistance to the pyrethroid class of insecticides with cross-resistance to DDT through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene. To enable detection of kdr mutations at low frequency a method was developed that uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based technology, allowing rapid, reliable and cost-effective testing of large numbers of individual mosquitoes. This was used to assay mosquitoes from sites in lower Moshi, Tanzania. Sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) were used for simultaneous detection of both East and West African kdr mutations with high specificity and sensitivity. Application of the SSOP-ELISA method to 1,620 field-collected Anopheles arabiensis from Tanzania identified the West African leucine-phenylalanine kdr mutation in two heterozygous individuals, indicating the potential for resistance development that requires close monitoring. The presence of the West African kdr mutation at low frequency in this East African population of An. arabiensis has implications for the spread of the kdr gene across the African continent"

Children with severe malaria are often brought late to health facilities and traditional health practitioners are said to be the main cause of treatment delay. In the context of the Rectal Artesunate Project in Tanzania, the role of traditional healers in the management of severe malaria in children was studied. A community cross-sectional study was conducted in Kilosa and Handeni Districts, involving four villages selected on the basis of existing statistics on the number of traditional health practitioners involved in the management of severe malaria. A total of 41 traditional health practitioners were selected using the snowballing technique, whereby in-depth interviews were used to collect information. Eight Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) involving traditional health practitioners, caregivers and community leaders were carried out in each district. Home management of fever involving sponging or washing with warm water at the household level, was widely practiced by caregivers. One important finding was that traditional health practitioners and mothers were not linking the local illness termed degedege, a prominent feature in severe malaria, to biomedically-defined malaria. The majority of mothers (75%) considered degedege to be caused by evil spirits. The healing process was therefore organized in stages and failure to abide to the procedure could lead to relapse of degedege, which was believed to be caused by evil spirits. Treatment seeking was, therefore, a complex process and mothers would consult traditional health practitioners and modern health care providers, back and forth. Referrals to health facilities increased during the Rectal Artesunate Project, whereby project staff facilitated the process after traditional medical care with the provision of suppositories. This finding is challenging the common view that traditional healers are an important factor of delay for malaria treatment, they actually play a pivotal role by giving ""bio-medically accepted first aid"" which leads to reduction in body temperature hence increasing chances of survival for the child. Increasing the collaboration between traditional healers and modern health care providers was shown to improve the management of severe malaria in the studied areas. Traditional health care is not necessarily a significant impediment or a delaying factor in the treatment of severe malaria. There is a need to foster training on the management of severe cases, periodically involving both traditional health practitioners and health workers to identify modalities of better collaboration."

Parasitological surveys for trypanosome and other blood parasites were conducted in selected villages. Interviews with health workers were conducted to explore facility capacity to diagnose and manage HAT. Community knowledge on tsetse and availability of trypanocidal drugs was explored. Results showed that, although health facility records showed HAT is an important public health problem in the three districts, typanosomes were found in 0.6% of the examined individuals in Urambo district only. Malaria parasites with a prevalence of 12.1%, 19.7% and 9.7%, in Urambo, Kibondo and Kasulu, respectively were detected in blood samples from the same individuals examined for trypanosomes. There was poor capacity for most of the health facilities in the diagnosis, treatment and control of HAT. In both districts, communities were knowledgeable of the tsetse identity (82.4%) and had experienced tsetse bites (94%). The majority (91.4%) of the community members knew that they were at risk of acquiring HAT. However, only 29% of the respondents knew that anti-trypanocidal drugs were readily available free of charge from health care facilities. Late treatment seeking behaviour was common in Kasulu and Urambo districts. In conclusion, health facilities in western Tanzania are faced with problems of poor capacity to diagnose and manage HAT and that treatment seeking behaviour among the communities at risk is poor. Efforts should be made to strengthen the capacity of the health facility to handle HAT cases and health education to the population at risk."

The aim was to verify whether Paracheck-Pf could be a reliable tool for the confirmation of malaria outbreaks in such areas. The overall measurements of the assay's performance were good, with a sensitivity of 90.0%, a specificity of 96.6%, a positive predictive value of 88.9%, and a negative predictive value of 97.0% (with an estimated malaria prevalence of 23.3%). There was, however, marked variation between the study districts, the assay's performance being relatively poor where the test had been stored for 12 months at room temperature (23.5+/-3.5 degrees C). The assay was easy to perform in the field and could clearly be a valuable tool in remote areas and in emergency situations, such as the early detection of malaria outbreaks. The cost of the assay (U.S.$0.62/test at the time of the present study) is sufficiently low that its routine use in the confirmation of P. falciparum malaria might also be cost-effective, particularly in areas where there are no facilities for microscopy and/or where the first-line treatment of malaria is based on relatively expensive artemisinin-based combinations."

Although malaria endemicity in the two municipalities is low, unplanned rapid urbanisation is likely to change malaria epidemiology in Tanzania. Continuous malaria and mosquito density surveillance should therefore, form an in integral part of the malaria control strategies in urban areas. Communities should be continuously sensitised to use insecticide-treated mosquito nets and strengthen community-based environmental management to minimise malaria breeding sites."

This finding has been interpreted as strong evidence that the WHO strategy of 5 years' mass drug administration (MDA) will result in elimination of this parasitic disease.2 Several key features should be borne in mind when making such conclusions. First, elimination of transmission in areas of low or moderate endemicities is unsurprising since this is predicted by mathematical models. The close fit of the Epifil model3 to the post-control microfilaria prevalence data from the two sentinel sites in Ramzy and colleagues' study highlights this (figure). Indeed, since the model predicts that 6 years' MDA at 80% coverage eliminates transmission if the target threshold is a microfilaria prevalence of 0·5% with a baseline of up to 10%,3then predictions for longer durations when baselines are greater in higher endemicity areas are also likely to be correct."

Public meetings in villages of Komtonga, Mbogo, Mkindo, Dihombo and Luhindo followed this. Findings from a research on the impact of agricultural practices on malaria burden in the district were shared with local communities, public sector officials and other key stakeholders as a basis for a participatory discussion. The community and key stakeholders had an opportunity to critically examine the linkages between agricultural practices and malaria in their villages and to identify problems and propose practical solutions. Several factors were identified as bottlenecks in the implementation of malaria control in the area. Lack of community participation and decision making in malaria interventions was expressed as among the major constraints. This denied the community the opportunities of determining their health priorities and accessing knowledge needed to effectively implement malaria interventions. In conclusion, this paper emphasizes the importance of participatory approach that involves community and other key stakeholders in malaria control using an ecosystem approach.

Beliefs about general illness causation included God's will, chance, natural/biological, ancestral spirits, and witchcraft. STIs were generally attributed to natural causes, but beliefs about AIDS causation were more complex. Few villagers had heard of HIV, but most had heard of AIDS and understood that AIDS could be contracted through sex. A small proportion of villagers knew that such an infected person might appear healthy, but they generally believed the asymptomatic period to last only a few months after exposure; if healthy beyond that, the person was not believed to have been infected. Many people in all villages reported belief in both a 'real' (natural) AIDS, which leads to certain death, and a similar illness caused by witchcraft, which can be cured using traditional medicine. Punishment of accused witches occurs officially and informally, and this may increase with increasing AIDS deaths.

Data collection consisted of 16 participatory group discussions with community members and 18 in-depth interviews with treatment-seekers. Although participants welcomed antiretroviral therapy, they feared that transportation and supplementary food costs, the referral hospital's reputation for being unfriendly and confusing, and difficulties in sustaining long-term treatment would limit accessibility. Fear of stigma framed all concerns, posing challenges for contacting referrals who did not want their status disclosed or expressed reluctance to identify a ""treatment buddy"" as required by the programme. To mitigate logistical barriers, transportation costs were paid and hospital visits facilitated. Participants reported satisfaction with eligibility testing, finding the process easier than anticipated. Most were willing to join a support group and some changed attitudes toward disclosure. However, both experienced and anticipated discrimination continue to hinder widespread antiretroviral therapy (ART) uptake. While simple measures to reduce perceived barriers improved initial access to treatment and helped overcome anxiety among early referrals, pervasive stigma remains the most formidable barrier. Encouraging successful referrals to share their positive experiences and contribute to nascent community mobililzation could start to address this seemingly intractable problem."

Generally, there was no distinct difference in the trends of patient attendances before and after user fee introduction. Public awareness about cost-sharing policy was high, but had low appreciation in the administration of exemptions and waivers. Shortage of drugs, laboratory facilities, and inhospitality of nurses lowered their confidence in the user-fee system. Autonomy to collect and prioritize expenditure of user-fee revenue at the healthfacility level was appreciated by community leaders and health workers who, however, had reservations with funds being held at the district level and delays by the DMO’s office in approving budgets submitted in request for expenditure of such revenues.

Similarly, the academic partners have acquired better understanding of community needs and how to address them. Until sufficient evidence is provided, community-based IVM remains an operational research activity. Researchers can never directly support every community in Africa so community-based IVM strategies and tactics will need to be incorporated into undergraduate teaching programmes to generate sufficient numbers of practitioners for national scale programmes.

(IFN-?)], apoptotic cells and apoptosis-related proteins [Bcl2, Bax, Fas ligand (FasL) and Fas] in the human tuberculous lymphadenitis lesions. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins has been shown to be exploited by mycobacteria to evade the immune response and persist in the host. Foreign body (FB) granulomas were used as controls. In tuberculosis (TB) granulomas, epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells expressed cytokines differently. In epithelioid cells, the numbers of TNF-?-, IL-10- and TGF-?-stained cells were higher than IFN-?-stained cells (P < 0·01). TGF-? and FasL were strongly expressed in the necrotic centres as compared with other cytokines. More giant cells expressed IL-10 and TGF-? than expressed TNF-? and IFN-? (P < 0·01). Staining of consecutive sections revealed that some giant cells expressed IL-10 but not TNF-?. Apoptotic TB giant cells correlated positively with the expression of TNF-?, IFN-? and TGF-?, but not with the expression of IL-10. The percentage of giant cells expressing Bax was lower than those expressing Fas, unlike the epithelioid cells, suggesting that TB giant cells are less susceptible to apoptosis. Compared with FB giant cells, there were fewer TB giant cells showing TNF-?, IFN-?, FasL, Fas expression or undergoing apoptosis (P < 0·05). Taken together, these observations show that the cellular microenvironment of TB granulomas down-regulates microbicidal functions, favouring bacillary survival and persistence. TGF-? and FasL may be responsible for tissue destruction. The giant cells, being less susceptible to apoptosis, may remain a continuous source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, causing immune pathology."

Overall prevalences were 7.9% for HIV, 43.5% for Wuchereria bancrofti-specific circulating filarial antigen (CFA), 12.3% for P. falciparum, 1.2% for A. lumbricoides, 7.1% for T. trichiura and 75.7% for hookworm. Anaemia was assessed separately for males and females and was found to be more prevalent among females (58.8%) than males (34.8%). When sex and age were controlled for, there was a statistically significant positive association between HIV and W. bancrofti (CFA) infection and between malaria and HIV, but not between malaria and W. bancrofti (CFA) infection. Hookworm infection was positively associated with W. bancrofti (CFA) infection but, surprisingly, negatively associated with HIV. Infection with HIV and hookworms, but not malaria, was associated with a significant reduction in haemoglobin concentration. These associations are likely to reflect underlying mechanisms that need to be clarified to better understand the role of co-infections in HIV pathogenesis, and vice versa."

About 17.2% of the respondents reported to have multiple sexual partners and only about half of the respondents reported the use of condoms. The level of education correlated significantly with the individual knowledge on HIV/AIDS (P = 0.003). There was no significant difference between urban and rural communities on their knowledge on HIV/AIDS (P > 0.05).

Estimate the ""true"" proportion (PAFM) of HIV infections attributable to STDs in the Mwanza and Rakai STD trial populations and explore how the evaluated interventions prevented HIV infections. The STDSIM model was used to simulate the 2 populations at the baseline of the trials (with no STD treatment interventions) and counterfactual scenarios in which STD cofactor effects on HIV spread were removed either at the start of the trials or 2, 10, and 20 years into the HIV epidemics. Similar methods were used to quantify the contribution of the cure of each STD to overall HIV impact in each site. : In Mwanza, the highest PAFM for the effect of any single STD over the 2 years of the trial was due to chancroid (40%). The PAFM for all curable STD was 65%. In Rakai, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) was the most important STD (PAFM = 23%); the PAFM for curable STD was 20%. In both sites, the proportion of new infections due to treatable STD decreased over time. The decrease was greater for Rakai, where a behavioral risk reduction that preceded the trial reduced STD prevalence. In both sites, the importance of HSV-2 increased later in the HIV epidemics and STD increased transmission of HIV more than acquisition of HIV. In the Mwanza trial, treatment of chancroid contributed most to preventing new HIV infections. PAFs calculated from empirical data underestimated the contribution of STD to HIV spread in the Mwanza and Rakai trial populations because STD effects on HIV transmission (as opposed to acquisition) were not captured in the observationally based studies."

From 1999-2002, participant observation was carried out in nine villages for a total of 158 person-weeks. Treatments were pluralistic and opportunistic, usually beginning with home remedies (western or traditional), followed by visits to traditional healers (THs) and/or health facilities (HFs). THs were sometimes preferred over HFs because of familiarity, trust, accessibility, expense, payment plans, and the perceived cause, nature and severity of the illness, e.g. only THs were believed to successfully treat bewitchment. Some people, particularly young girls, delayed or avoided seeking treatment for STIs for fear of stigma. Most STIs were attributed to natural causes, but AIDS was sometimes attributed to witchcraft. Locally available biomedical care of people with AIDS-like symptoms consisted of basic treatment of opportunistic infections. Most such individuals repeatedly visited THs and HFs, but many stopped attending HFs because they came to believe they could not be cured there. Some THs claimed to cure witchcraft-induced, AIDS-like illnesses. There is an urgent need for improved biomedical services, and TH interventions could be important in future HIV/AIDS education and care."

From 1999–2002, six researchers carried out participant observation in nine villages for a total of 158 person?weeks. Many villagers perceived condoms negatively for multiple reasons, for example, the method's association with infection or promiscuity, reduced male sexual pleasure, and cultural understandings of meaningful sex. Men controlled the terms of sexual encounters and reported that they would use condoms only with risky partners, but few perceived their partners as such. Use of condoms appeared to be very low, primarily as a result of limited demand, although barriers to access also existed. These qualitative findings contrast with inconsistent survey reports of relatively high condom use in the same population. Intervention efforts should address the tradeoff between possible short? and long?term consequences of condom use, particularly for men, for example, reduced pleasure versus reduced HIV risk. If possible, surveys should assess the validity of reported condom use through comparison with other data, including qualitative findings and distribution/sales records."

Les populations, devant l’hostilité grandissante de la nature, ont longtemps choisi des stratégies traditionnelles de conservation des eaux et des sols ou la migration. Ainsi, l’aménagement hydraulique en particulier les barrages, en tant qu’action anthropique sur les milieux naturels, notion souvent liée à celle du risque environnemental et sanitaire, apparaît comme une alternative négociable, une réponse aux incertitudes climatiques et à la pression démographique. Au Burkina Faso, la construction des barrages est souhaitée par les populations. Et cela, d’abord parce qu’il en résulte une disponibilité en eau pour l’alimentation des hommes et des animaux. Ensuite la présence d’eau permet les cultures de décrue, l’irrigation, la pêche, le pâturage. La satisfaction que représente la proximité d’un plan d’eau est suffisamment ressentie par les populations dans toutes les régions et aujourd’hui les petits barrages et les aménagements hydro-agricoles qui sont souvent associés, font de plus en plus partie des paysages Burkinabè.Dans ces conditions, les barrages et les aménagements hydro-agricoles constituent les nouveaux pôles de développement afin de faire face à la diminution de la disponibilité alimentaire par habitant, elle-même consécutive à l’accroissement démographique. Toutefois, ces choix ne doivent pas masquer les nombreux risques sanitaires susceptibles d’être associés aux hydro-aménagements. Parmi les parasitoses eau-dépendante, les  bilharzioses et les géohelminthes apparaissent comme des affections particulièrement sensibles aux modifications des relations entre la communauté humaine et leur environnement aquatique car l’un de leurs traits caractéristiques est leur capacité à s’adapter et à bénéficier des transformations du milieu induites par les aménagements hydro-agricoles. Plusieurs facteurs sont souvent indexés à leur survenue, à leur expansion et aux difficultés de contrôle entre autres : la typologie des biotopes aquatiques, leur juxtaposition dans l’espace, la distribution et la dynamique des populations de parasites, de vecteurs et d’hôtes intermédiaires, les mouvements des populations humaines avec différentes souches de parasites et leur  état immunitaire,  les comportements de l’homme (contact homme-eau - parasite) et l’hygiène du milieu, la perception des maladies par les populations humaines, les chemins thérapeutiques et par conséquent la pertinence de l’IEC, le statut de la femme et de l’enfant dans les schémas de transmission parasitaire et de recours aux soins. Il ressort que les aménagements hydrauliques constituent des facteurs amplificateurs de la prolifération des vecteurs de transmission et des flux parasitaires hôte-parasite. Tous les acteurs (aménageurs, populations et scientifiques) sont interpellés pour atténuer voir réduire le développement des maladies qui amoindrissent le bénéfice attendu des aménagements hydro-agricoles."

The objective of this study was to assess effects of multi-vitamin/mineral (MVM) and zinc (Zn) supplementation during TB treatment on mortality. Patients diagnosed with sputum-positive pulmonary TB in Mwanza, Tanzania, were randomised, using a two-by-two factorial design, to Zn (45 mg) or placebo, and MVM (vitamins A, B, C, D, E, and selenium and copper) or placebo. Survival status was ascertained at the end of the 8-month TB treatment and supplementation period. Of 499 TB patients, 213 (43 %) had HIV. The mean weight gain at 7 months was 6.88 kg (95 % CI 6.36, 7.41). Zn and MVM combined, but neither alone (interaction, P=0.03), increased weight gain by 2.37 kg (95 % CI 0.91, 3.83), irrespective of HIV status. Survival status at 8 months was determined for 422 patients (84.6 %), of which fifty-two (12.3 %) had died. Among fifty-two deaths, there were no effects of MVM (relative risk (RR) 0.73; 95 % CI 0.43, 1.23) and Zn (RR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.46, 1.28). However, among HIV co-infected patients, marginally significant effects of both MVM (RR 0.60; 95 % CI 0.34, 1.05) and Zn (RR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.37, 1.08) were seen, and MVM and Zn combined reduced mortality (RR 0.29; 95 % CI 0.10, 0.80; interaction ratio 0.52). In conclusion, supplementation with MVM, including Zn, during treatment of pulmonary TB may reduce mortality in those co-infected with HIV. A randomised trial of the effect of the combined intervention used in this study should be conducted in a different setting to confirm the finding."

Overall, new genotypes were acquired at a rate of 0.064 per day, and the average duration of infections was estimated to be 23 d. The highest recovery rates were in children under 4 months of age. The higher susceptibility of infants to clinical malaria in comparison with older children, in areas of very high transmission, may be largely a consequence of the short duration of infections which precludes the establishment of concomitant immunity. The high turnover of infections also implies that infection prevalence and multiplicity approach an equilibrium even in very young children, and calls into question the use of infant conversion rates as a measure of transmission intensity."

The prevalence projection produced by EPP can be transferred to SPECTRUM, a demographic projection model, to calculate the number of AIDS deaths. This paper presents estimates and projections of HIV prevalence, new cases of HIV infections and AIDS deaths in Tanzania between 2001 and 2010 using the EPP 2005 and SPECTRUM soft-wares on ANC data. METHODS: For this study we used; the 1985-2004 ANC data set, the 2005 UN population estimates for urban and rural adults, which is based on the 2002 population census, and results of the 2003 Tanzania HIV Indicator Survey. The ANC surveillance sites were categorized into urban and rural areas on the basis of the standard national definitions of urban and rural areas, which led to 40 urban and 35 rural clinic sites. The rural and urban epidemics were run independently by fitting the model to all data and on level fits. RESULTS: The national HIV prevalence increased from 0% in 1981 to a peak of 8.1% in 1995, and gradually decreased to 6.5% in 2004 which stabilized until 2010. The urban HIV epidemic increased from 0% in 1981 peaking at 12.6% in 1992 and leveled to between 10.9% and 11.8% from 2003 to 2010. The rural epidemic peaked in 1995 at 7.0% and gradually declined to 5.2% in 2004, and then stabilized at between 5.1% and 5.3% from 2005 to 2010. New infections are projected to rise steadily, resulting in 250,000 new cases in 2010. Deaths due to AIDS started in 1985 and rose steadily to reach 120,000 deaths in 2010, with more females dying than men. CONCLUSION: The fact that the number of new infections is projected to increase steadily to reach 250,000 per year in 2010 calls for more concerted efforts to combat the spread of HIV infection particularly in the rural areas where the infrastructure needed for prevention programmes such as counseling and testing, condom accessibility and AIDS information is less developed."

Conclusion: The high HIV prevalence observed among the ANC clinic attendees in Tanzania call for expansion of current voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services and access to antiretroviral drugs (ARV) in the clinics. There is also a need for modification of obstetric practices and infant feeding options in HIV infection in order to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV.

For each sex, we obtained adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for biomedical and behavioral factors.  RESULTS: We analyzed 92 case patients and 903 control subjects. In both sexes, the incidence of HIV infection was significantly higher in subjects with an HIV-positive spouse than in those with HIV-negative spouse (men: OR, 25.1; women: OR, 34.0).

CONCLUSION: HSV-2 infection was the most important risk factor for HIV infection, which highlights the need for HSV-2 interventions in HIV infection control, and there were particularly strong associations with recent HSV-2 seroconversion. The PAF associated with having an HIV-positive spouse was low, but this is likely to increase during the epidemic."

We found that IgG1/IgG3 class switching is independently affected by the nature of the antigen, cumulative exposure to the antigen, and the maturity of the immune system (i.e., the age of the individual). These observations provide insights into the effects of immune system maturity, the duration and intensity of antigen exposure, and inherent characteristics of individual antigens on the process of class switching in human B cells.

Recently, four rapid point-of-care (POC) syphilis tests were evaluated in Mwanza, and found to have reasonable sensitivity/specificity. This analysis estimates the relative cost-effectiveness of using these POC tests in the Mwanza syphilis screening intervention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  METHODS: Empirical cost and epidemiological data were used to model the potential benefit of using POC tests instead of RPR. Reductions in costs relating to training, supplies, and equipment were estimated, and any changes in impact due to test sensitivity were included. Additional modelling explored how the results vary with prevalence of past infection, misclassified RPR results, and if not all women return for treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of using POC tests is mainly dependent on their cost and sensitivity for high titre active syphilis (HTAS). Savings due to reductions in training and equipment are small. Current POC tests may save more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) than the RPR test in Mwanza, but the test cost needs to be <0.63 US dollars to be as cost-effective as RPR. However, the cost-effectiveness of the RPR test worsens by 15% if its HTAS sensitivity had been 75% instead of 86%, and by 25-65% if 20-40% of women had not returned for treatment. In such settings, POC tests could improve cost-effectiveness. Lastly, the cost-effectiveness of POC tests is affected little by the prevalence of syphilis, false RPR-positives, and past infections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            DISCUSSION: Although the price of most POC tests needs to be reduced to make them as cost-effective as RPR, their simplicity and limited requirements for electricity/equipment suggest their use could improve the coverage of antenatal syphilis screening in developing countries."

OBJECTIVE: To assess the acceptability of community and health facility-based direct observation of treatment (DOT) of tuberculosis (TB) patients in Temeke district.                              DESIGN: Both quantitative and qualitative study methodologies were used. Eight focus group discussions were carried out with TB patients, treatment supporters, health workers and community members. Quantitative study was also carried out among TB patients and treatment supporters.    RESULTS: A total of 268 patients and 103 treatment supporters were enrolled in the study. The majority of the patients (75%) were satisfied with the DOT options they received. Males were more satisfied with community-based DOT (84%) than females (67%) (OR 4.96, 95% CI 1.38-17.86). The majority (81%) were willing to supervise another TB patient. The results of the qualitative study demonstrated that community-based DOT was preferred because it was found to be convenient, reduced costs, saved time of the patients and reduced workload in health services. The main challenge of community-based DOT was to ensure effective supervision and monitoring of patients and treatment supporters in the community.                                                                                                                                                   CONCLUSION: The results from the quantitative and qualitative studies indicate that both DOT options were acceptable. The study has also identified key challenges and opportunities for effective implementation of community-based DOT interventions that are relevant, sensitive and acceptable to the population. Community-based DOT is a viable option and can complement and strengthen the existing health facility-based DOT, especially in countries like Tanzania where the health system is overwhelmed with increasing number of TB and HIV/AIDS patients."

Social Science and Medicine 62:987-997.",Contradictory sexual norms and expectations for young people in rural northern Tanzania,sexual norms,Social Science and Medicine,2006,62,,987,997,6,,,,,,,,,"There has been a long-running debate as to whether sexual cultures in sub-Saharan Africa are permissive or characterised by restrictive rules, rituals and self-restraint. This paper, based on participant observation data, outlines the main features of sexual culture in rural northern Tanzania and highlights both permissive and restrictive norms and expectations for young people. It also illustrates how sexual beliefs are socially constructed and subject to social change. Sexual activity is constrained by clear norms of school pupil abstinence, female sexual respectability and taboos around the discussion of sex. However, these norms are incompatible with several widely held expectations: that sexual activity is inevitable unless prevented, sex is a female resource to be exploited, restrictions on sexual activity are relaxed at festivals, and masculine esteem is boosted through sexual experience. Differential commitment to these norms and expectations reflects conflicts between generations and genders. Young people appear to manage the contradictions in these norms by concealing their sexual relationships. This almost certainly contributes to their short duration and the high levels of partner change, since relationships are not reinforced through social recognition and there is little scope to develop intimacy through non-sexual contacts."

Cost is a major barrier to deployment. There is little evidence from field trials on the cost-effectiveness of these new combinations.                                                                                                                                                                                              METHODS AND FINDINGS: An economic evaluation of drug combinations was designed around a randomised effectiveness trial of combinations recommended by the WHO, used to treat Tanzanian children with non-severe slide-proven malaria. Drug combinations were: amodiaquine (AQ), AQ with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ+SP), AQ with artesunate (AQ+AS), and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) in a six-dose regimen. Effectiveness was measured in terms of resource savings and cases of malaria averted (based on parasitological failure rates at days 14 and 28). All costs to providers and to patients and their families were estimated and uncertain variables were subjected to univariate sensitivity analysis. Incremental analysis comparing each combination to monotherapy (AQ) revealed that from a societal perspective AL was most cost-effective at day 14. At day 28 the difference between AL and AQ+AS was negligible; both resulted in a gross savings of approximately US1.70 dollars or a net saving of US22.40 dollars per case averted. Varying the accuracy of diagnosis and the subsistence wage rate used to value unpaid work had a significant effect on the number of cases averted and on programme costs, respectively, but this did not change the finding that AL and AQ+AS dominate monotherapy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        CONCLUSIONS: In an area of high drug resistance, there is evidence that AL and AQ+AS are the most cost-effective drugs despite being the most expensive, because they are significantly more effective than other options and therefore reduce the need for further treatment. This is not necessarily the case in parts of Africa where recrudescence following SP and AQ treatment (and their combination) is lower so that the relative advantage of ACTs is smaller, or where diagnostic services are not accurate and as a result much of the drug goes to those who do not have malaria."

The aim of the present analysis was to determine comparative changes in stillbirth prevalence between two areas of Tanzania with different malaria transmission patterns in order to estimate the malaria attributable component. Methods: A retrospective analysis was completed of stillbirth differences between primigravidae and multigravidae in relation to malaria cases and transmission patterns for two different areas of Tanzania with a focus on the effects of the El Nino southern climatic oscillation ( ENSO). One area, Kagera, experiences outbreaks of malaria, and the other area, Morogoro, is holoendemic. Delivery and malaria data were collected over a six year period from records of the two district hospitals in these locations. Results: There was a significantly higher prevalence of low birthweight in primigravidae compared to multigravidae for both data sets. Low birthweight and stillbirth prevalence ( 17.5% and 4.8%) were significantly higher in Kilosa compared to Ndolage ( 11.9% and 2.4%). There was a significant difference in stillbirth prevalence between Ndolage and Kilosa between malaria seasons ( 2.4% and 5.6% respectively, p < 0.001) and during malaria seasons ( 1.9% and 5.9% respectively, p < 0.001). During ENSO there was no difference ( 4.1% and 4.9%, respectively). There was a significant difference in low birthweight prevalence between Ndolage and Kilosa between malaria seasons ( 14.4% and 23.0% respectively, p < 0.001) and in relation to malaria seasons ( 13.9% and 25.2% respectively, p < 0.001). During ENSO there was no difference ( 22.2% and 19.8%, respectively). Increased low birthweight risk occurred approximately five months following peak malaria prevalence, but stillbirth risk increased at the time of malaria peaks. Conclusion: Malaria exposure during pregnancy has a delayed effect on birthweight outcomes, but a more acute effect on stillbirth risk."

Because acquisition and maintenance of antimalarial antibodies depend on exposure to malaria infection, such antibodies might be used as proxy measures of transmission intensity. We have compared the prevalence of IgG antibodies with three Plasmodium falciparum asexual stage antigens in individuals of all ages living at varying altitudes encompassing a range of transmission intensities from hyper- to hypoendemic in northeastern Tanzania, with alternative measures of transmission intensity. The prevalence of antibodies to merozoite surface protein-1(19) was significantly more closely correlated with altitude than either point-prevalence malaria parasitemia or single measures of hemoglobin concentration. Analysis of age-specific seroprevalence rates enabled differentiation of recent (seasonal) changes in transmission intensity from longer-term transmission trends and, using a mathematical model of the annual rate of seroconversion, estimation of the longevity of the antibody response. Thus, serological tools allow us to detect variations in malaria transmission over time. Such tools will be invaluable for monitoring trends in malaria endemicity and the effectiveness of malaria control programs."

In sub-Saharan Africa, a few predominant polymorphic variants of each gene account for a majority of these deficiencies. Examining at a larger scale the clinical importance of these independent genetic disorders, their possible association with malaria pathogenesis and innate resistance, and their relevance for antimalarial drug treatment, would be easier if an accurate screening method with limited costs was available. A simple and rapid technique was developed to detect the most prominent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HbB and G6PD genes. The method is able to detect the different haemoglobin polymorphisms A, S, C and E, as well as G6PD polymorphisms B, A and A- based on PCR-amplification followed by a hybridization step using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOPs) specific for the SNP variants and quantified by ELISA. The SSOP-ELISA method was found to be specific, and compared well to the commonly used PCR-RFLP technique. Identical results were obtained in 98% (haemoglobin) and 95% (G6PD) of the tested 90 field samples from a high-transmission area in Tanzania, which were used to validate the new technique. The simplicity and accuracy of the new methodology makes it suitable for application in settings where resources are limited. It would serve as a valuable tool for research purposes by monitoring genotype frequencies in relation to disease epidemiology."

Long?lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have special treatments intended to remain effective after many washes. The present trials assessed the efficacy and wash?resistance of several production batches of PermaNet™ (polyester net coated with polymer resin containing pyrethroid insecticide deltamethrin 55?mg ai/m2) against malaria vectors in Pakistan, Iran and Tanzania compared to ITNs conventionally treated with alphacypermethrin 15 or 20?mg ai/m2, or deltamethrin 25 or 50?mg ai/m2. Insecticidal efficacy of the nets before and after repeated washing (using W.H.O. recommended and traditional local washing procedures) was monitored through contact bioassays with Anopheles and by experimental hut and outdoor platform tests. Local washing regimes gradually reduced the insecticidal efficacy of conventionally treated nets, but they were not exhausted, even after 21 washes. Using a more rigorous laboratory washing method, insecticide was more readily stripped from conventionally treated nets. PermaNet retained high efficacy after 21 washes, giving more than 97% mortality of Anopheles in contact bioassays with 3?min exposure. Using the more sensitive bioassay criterion of ‘median time to knockdown’, PermaNet showed no loss of insecticidal activity againstAnopheles after washing repeatedly in 2 out of 6 trials; whereas in a further three trials knockdown activity of PermaNet and conventional ITNs declined at comparable rates. Higher mortality levels of Anopheles in contact bioassays did not always translate to superiority in experimental hut or enclosed platform trials. In only one of four comparative field trials did PermaNet out?perform conventional ITNs after washing: this was in the trial of PermaNet 2.0 – the product with improved quality assurance. Because PermaNet and conventionally treated nets were both quite tolerant of local washing procedures, it is important in field trials to compare LLINs with conventional ITNs washed an equivalent number of times. Our comparison of PermaNet 2.0 against conventionally treated deltamethrin nets (CTDN) in Pakistan demonstrated superior performance of the LLIN after 20 washes in phase I and phase II bioassays, and this was corroborated by chemical assays of residual deltamethrin. Although PermaNet 2.0 has received WHOPES interim recommendation for malaria control purposes, its performance should be monitored in everyday use throughout its lifespan in various cultural settings to assess its durability and long?term effectiveness for malaria prevention and control. As many millions of conventionally treated nets are already in routine use, and these will require regular re?treatment, programme strategies should be careful to preserve the effectiveness of ITNS before and after establishing the reliability of LLINs in long?term use."

Impact measures included incidence and prevalence of HIV and other STIs, pregnancy rates, knowledge and reported attitudes and sexual behaviour, as well as qualitative assessments. Results of the baseline survey of the cohort have been presented previously. The outcome of the trial will be reported separately. Behaviour change interventions among adolescents have been widely advocated, but there have been few rigorously designed trials of their effectiveness, particularly in developing countries, and measurement of sexual behaviour is particularly problematic in this age group. The MEMA kwa Vijana trial was undertaken to address these problems and to collect rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of an innovative intervention, designed to be implemented on a very large scale."

Fusion proteins comprising the extra-cellular domain of CTLA4, the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG1 and MSP-1 gene fragments were expressed in COS-7 cells. Three of the secreted proteins containing the mouse homologue of CTLA4 were shown to bind differently to the human B7-1 molecule expressed on THP-1 cells.

Methods: A descriptive analysis of road traffic accidents (RTA) was done using outline accident records from the Coast Region Traffic Office and Tumbi Special Hospital, Tanzania. Data of time series from 1995 - 1996 were analyzed. Results: A total of 3,098 road traffic accidents occurred along the Kiluvya - Bwawani and Chalinze - Segera Highways with an average of 516 accidents per year. This corresponds to 1.4 accidents per day. Ordinary accidents had the highest toll in the area, whereas injury accidents increased from 28.6% in 1995 to 37.9%, 41.7% and 43% in 1996, 1997 and 1998, respectively. An important observation on the trend of accidents in this study was the significant decrease in number of accidents in 2000 but with an appreciable increase in fatal accidents. There were a total of 768 deaths due to road traffic accidents from the study area between 1995 and 2000. A total of 665 males and 103 females died due to the accidents in the same period. More males died in road traffic accidents than females. The average annual deaths of males were 111 and 17 for females. The male to female death ratio was 6.5:1 from 1996 to 1999, annual case fatality rate (CFR) in passengers was higher than other groups. The overall CFR from 1995 to 2000 for passengers was 42.1%, 37.8% in pedestrians, 13% for cyclists and 9% for drivers. In the year 2000, vehicle - pedestrian collisions were most severe and had the highest CFR of 52.9%. Conclusion: The trends of RTA in this study illustrate a rapidly growing problem in the country. The high pedestrian and passenger deaths imply the need to investigate the underlying risk factors, operational and policy issues involved in the transportation system, and to develop and implement appropriate responsive road safety interventions. A well planned scientific approach to study the characteristics of injury- producing accidents including trends, distribution patterns, type of vehicles involved, and road-users injured or killed has to be made."

Strengthened research capacity to understand the social determinants of health among different African populations is key to addressing the drivers of poor health and developing interventions to improve health outcomes and health systems in the region. Yet, the continent clearly lacks centers of research excellence that can generate a strong evidence base to address the region's socio-economic and health problems.                                                                                          Objective and program overview: We describe the recently launched Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa (CARTA), which brings together a network of nine academic and four research institutions from West, East, Central, and Southern Africa, and select northern universities and training institutes. CARTA's program of activities comprises two primary, interrelated, and mutually reinforcing objectives: to strengthen research infrastructure and capacity at African universities; and to support doctoral training through the creation of a collaborative doctoral training program in population and public health. The ultimate goal of CARTA is to build local research capacity to understand the determinants of population health and effectively intervene to improve health outcomes and health systems.                                                                                                                                                                            Conclusions: CARTA's focus on the local production of networked and high-skilled researchers committed to working in sub-Saharan Africa, and on the concomitant increase in local research and training capacity of African universities and research institutes addresses the inability of existing programs to create a critical mass of well-trained and networked researchers across the continent. The initiative's goal of strengthening human resources and university-wide systems critical to the success and sustainability of research productivity in public and population health will rejuvenate institutional teaching, research, and administrative systems."

This study was conducted to analyse if a similar relationship could be documented in an area of intense malaria transmission. A six month longitudinal study was conducted in an area of holoendemic malaria transmission in north-eastern Tanzania, where the incidence of febrile malaria decreased sharply by the age of three years, and anaemia constituted a significant part of the malaria disease burden. Plasma antibodies to glutamate rich protein (GLURP) were analysed and related with protection against malaria morbidity in models correcting for the effect of age. The risk of febrile malaria episodes was reduced significantly in children with measurable anti-GLURP IgG1 antibodies at enrollment [adjusted odds ratio: 0.39 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.99); P = 0.047]. Interestingly, there was an inverse relationship between the plasma anti-GLURP IgG1 and IgG3 levels and the levels of parasitaemia at enrollment. However, anti-GLURP IgG2 and IgG4 levels were not associated with reduction in parasite density. Similarly, antibody levels were not associated with haemoglobin levels or anaemia risk. Cytophilic IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies against R0-GLURP may contribute to the control of parasite multiplication and reduction in febrile malaria incidence in children living in an area of intense malaria transmission."

Indoor resting mosquitoes were collected in ten houses in each of the ten villages covered. Health facility data for 1999 showed the highest (60.7%) and lowest (11.5%) annual malaria morbidity rates were recorded at Itumba and at Ibaba, respectively. Malaria parasitaemia rate among schoolchildren ranged from 0-36.7%; the lowest prevalence was observed in the high altitude mountainous range and the highest in the lower altitude plateaux. Of 1,504 mosquitoes caught, 205 (13.6%) were female Anopheles gambiae s.l., 215 (14.3%) An. funestus and 68.9% were culicines. Data from both health facility records and school surveys indicate that there is high malaria morbidity in the lower plateaux (1100 to =1350 m), around Itumba and Isongole, where indoor anopheles mosquito densities were relatively higher than in the higher altitudes (> 1,350 m) around Ibaba. In the lower altitude range, there was less malaria on steep slopes than on flat terrain. Further studies are recommended to closely monitor malaria situation in these epidemic prone highlands of southwest Tanzania."

At the Abuja Summit in April 2000 Tanzania committed itself to protect 60% of its population at high risk of malaria by 2005. The country is, therefore, determined to ensure that sustainable malaria control using insecticide-treated nets is carried out on a national scale. Tanzania has been involved for two decades in the research process for developing insecticide-treated nets as a malaria control tool, from testing insecticides and net types, to assessing their efficacy and effectiveness, and exploring new ways of distribution. Since 2000, the emphasis has changed from a project approach to that of a concerted multi-stakeholder action for taking insecticide-treated nets to national scale (NATNETS). This means creating conditions that make insecticide-treated nets accessible and affordable to all those at risk of malaria in the country. This paper describes Tanzania's experience in (1) creating an enabling environment for insecticide-treated nets scale-up, (2) promoting the development of a commercial sector for insecticide-treated nets, and (3) targeting pregnant women with highly subsidized insecticide-treated nets through a national voucher scheme. As a result, nearly 2 million insecticide-treated nets and 2.2 million re-treatment kits were distributed in 2004. National upscaling of insecticide-treated nets is possible when the programme is well designed, coordinated and supported by committed stakeholders; the Abuja target of protecting 60% of those at high risk is feasible, even for large endemic countries."

We conducted this study to trace the experience and knowledge of lay people as a supplement to using 'health experts' in priority setting using malaria as a tracer condition. The patients/caregivers, women's group representatives, youth leaders, religious leaders and community leaders/elders constituted the principal subjects. Emphasis was on providing qualitative data, which are of vital consideration in multi-disciplinary oriented studies, and not on quantitative information from larger samples. We found a high level of agreement across groups, that malaria remains the leading health problem in Moshi rural district in Tanzania both in the highland and lowland areas. Our findings also indicate that 'non-medical' issues including lack of water, hunger and poverty heralded priority in the list implying that priorities should not only be focused on diseases, but should also include health services and social cultural issues. Indeed, methods which are easily understood and applied thus able to give results close to those provided by the burden of disease approaches should be adopted. It is the provision of ownership of the derived health priorities to partners including the community that enhances research utilization of the end results. In addition to disease-based methods, the Nominal Group Technique is being proposed as an important research tool for involving the non-experts in priority setting in Tanzania."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of O. suave volatile oil in repelling mosquitoes in the natural field condition in Muheza, Tanzania. METHODS: O. suave plant materials were steam-distilled and the oil formulation tested for repellency effectiveness against laboratory and field mosquitoes. A latin square design was applied for randomly assigning the treatment and control to the tests over different nights. RESULTS: The white petroleum formulation containing 10% of O. suave volatile oil provided protection against mosquito bites from Anopheles funestus of 66.67%, Anopheles gambiae of 45.40%, Anopheles coustan of 50.00%, Culex quinquefasciatus of 73.31%, Culex cinereus of 62.36% and Aedes aegypti of 100%. The 20% O. suave volatile oil formulation was more effective with better protection against mosquito bites from An. gambiae of 83.3%, Culex quinquefasciatus of 75.34%, and Culex cinereus of 100% (P < 0.0001). The formulation containing 10% DEET was shown stronger protection against mosquito bites from Anopheles funestus of 100%, Anopheles gambiae of 77.3%, Culex quinquefasciatus of 99.02%, Culex cinereus of 100% and Aedes aegypti of 100% (P < 0.0001) whereas the 20% DEET formulation shown 100% (P < 0.0001) repellency to all field mosquito vector species. CONCLUSION: O. suave volatile oil significantly repelled Anopheline and Culicine mosquitoes under natural field conditions in Muheza, Tanzania. On this regard, O. suave volatile oil can offer cost-effective alternative as additional means of household protection, and a useful complement to bed nets, particularly for the early part of the evening before bedtime."

Adults and immature An. saperoi were collected from the Yona Forest area, taken to the laboratory and maintained under a controlled temperature and humidity in order to get a lager number of mosquitos for the mark-release-recapture experiments. Cohorts of An. saperoi females and males, numbering 3,016, 4,728, 327, and 2,603 for experiments I, II, III, and IV, respectively, were released. Cohorts of An. saperoi females only, numbering 709 and 586 for experiments V and VI, respectively, were also released.

The length of the gonotrophic cycle of the recaptured An. saperoi females was estimated to be about 4 days, through the dissection method. The daily survival rate was estimated to be 0.73 by regression coefficient. The spatial distribution of marked, recaptured An. saperoi was similar to that of unmarked captured An. saperoi. The spatial distribution of the marked, recaptured An. saperoi among the collection site categories was significantly different. The observed differences in the frequency distribution of marked recaptured An. saperoi were considered to be due to the spatial variation of the habitats between the collection sites. The maximum flight range of the recaptured An. saperoi recorded in this study was 0.93 km.

A number of methods have been used in sampling mosquitoes for the purpose of estimating the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) and each is subject to some bias or shortcomings. It was the aim of this paper to critically evaluate the most common mosquito sampling techniques in relation to their reliability in the estimation of EIR. The techniques include man-landing, light trap, light trap/bednet combination and odour-baited traps. Although man-landing technique is the most reliable, it however, expose the catcher to mosquito-borne infections. On the other hand, light traps have been found to capture mosquitoes with higher sporozoite rates as compared to those from human bait catch thus leading to an overestimation of EIR. From an epidemiological point of view, the use of light-trap-bed net combination is an approach that is more meaningful than using light trap alone because, a light trap functions more efficiently when placed near the normal flight paths of mosquitoes such as inside huts or under the eaves. Unfortunately, it has been shown that estimates of EIR are influenced by trap position, hence affecting the number caught and the sporozoite rates. A variety of bednets have been used to sample mosquitoes attracted to man. Studies have shown that bednet traps normally catch fewer mosquitoes than do human baits outside them. Although the collections by indoor resting technique give a good estimate of the mean house density in a given area, they may not necessarily give a good estimate of EIR. Thus the development of improved sampling systems based on an improved understanding of host-oriented behaviour is needed. Moreover, there is need to standardise all the sampling techniques in use to enable us make valid comparisons between various studies done by different people and in different areas. In this article, the inherent limitations of conventional mosquito sampling techniques when used in estimating the EIR are discussed."

It is only when correct and timely reports about disease outbreaks reaches the responsible persons that prompt actions can be taken. Tanzania is in the process of strengthening its infectious disease surveillance system using an integrated approach. However, several constraints hamper the smooth implementation of the new strategy (Miller et al., 2003). Under the current Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy, health facilities in Tanzania are required to immediately notify the district when they suspect an outbreak, and to provide week-ending reports for 7 outbreak-prone diseases, and monthlyreports for 13 priority diseases (Mboera, 2004). Vital epidemiological information available at most health facilities in Tanzania are not often readily available for decision making at the district and national levels. This is due to lack of adequate information exchange facilities and systems that allow for a rapid access of information available at one level or both levels. Epidemiological reporting between facility and district levels of health delivery system has remained poor due to lack of effective and efficient means of communication (Miller et al., 2003; Kajeguka & Mboera, 2003). In a recent study in 12 districts of Tanzania, the overall timeliness reporting from facility to district level was found to be 8% (0-19%) for weekly reports and 24% (3-56%) for montly reports (Gueye et al., 2005). Some routine paper reports are currently being picked up during supervision and outreach visits, but these visits are quite irregular. Some reports are sent by radio call and hard copies delivered in person. In this paper, we report the use of a participatory process in solving weekly epidemiological surveillance reporting problem in Dodoma Rural district in Tanzania. Dodoma Rural District (6o, 30’ to 8o0’S, 35o, 30’ to 37o 0’E) is located in the central plateaus in Tanzania at an elevation of about 800-1200m above sea level. The district consists of a number of mountain chains, between which are low-lying flat areas. A number of depressions are associated with these lower areas, which are generally waterlogged during the rainy season and have a tendency of salinity because of their limited outflow. The district has a dry Savannah type of climate characterised by a long dry season lasting between April and November. The average annual rainfall is 500800mm, which is normally a short single wet season lasting between December and March. The district is made up of 8 divisions, 48 wards, and 128 villages covering an area of 14,004 km. The district population is 495,176 made up of 96,686 households. The district is served by 81 health facilities (1 hospital, 6 health centres and 74 dispensaries). The nearest and furthest health facilities are 37 km and 145 km from the district capital, respectively (Mboera et al., 2005). The participatory process approach involved researchers from the National Institute for Medical Research, district council health management team (CHMT) and the in-charges of all facilities in the district. The CHMT and health workers were trained to carry out problem-solving participatory approach in the area of communication. Following the discussions, strategies were developed and documented. Eighty-one health facilities were involved in the discussion in four different sessions. During the discussion several means of communication were suggested by the participants. These included: public bus transport, radio calls, passenger train, mobile phones and bicycles. The use of public buses was given the highest priority. "

Nineteen pastoral herds were also included in the study. A questionnaire survey was used to assess milking practices while clinical examination of animals, California mastitis test (CMT) and microbiological assessments of milk were used to establish the status of mastitis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and single comparative intra-dermal tuberculin tests (SCITT) were used to determine the prevalence of bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis respectively. In addition, milk samples were cultured for isolation of Mycobacterium species using standard techniques. While all animals were free of clinical mastitis at the time of farm visits, based on CMT at animal level, the prevalence of sub-clinical mastitis was significantly higher in dairy (61.2%) than in the traditional cattle (26.3%). Based on cultures, the prevalence of mastitis was also significantly higher in dairy animals at both herd and animal levels than in traditional animals. The isolation rates of aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria, yeast, mucor and aspergillus in dairy herds at animal level were 62.4%, 0%, 30.6%, 1.2% and 8.2% respectively, whereas in the traditional animals, the isolates were aerobic bacteria (39.5%) and aspergillus (13.2%). In both dairy and traditional cattle, aerobic bacterial isolates comprised Staphylococcus epidermidis (55), Staphylococcus aureus (14), Staphylococcus intermedius (1), unidentified Staphylococcus species (26), Escherichia coli(7), Klebsiella spp (6), Serratia spp (6), Arcanobacter pyogenes (2), Bacillus spp (2) and unclassified bacteria (3). Whereas the seroprevalence of brucellosis was 3.9% and 4.8% in dairy and traditional cattle respectively, all tested animals were negative based on SCITT. Atypical mycobacteria were isolated from milk in dairy (15.3%) and traditional (5.1%) animals and the isolates comprised Mycobacterium gordonae (4), Mycobacterium phlei (3), Mycobacterium fortuitum (3); Mycobacterium smegmatis (2), Mycobacterium flavescens (2) and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (1). The findings indicate that the prevalence of mastitis might be lower in the traditional sector than in smallholder dairy animals and that consumption of raw milk may be associated with health risks to consumers in relation to brucellosis and atypical mycobacteria infections albeit their low prevalence."

RESULTS: About 90% (387/423) of patients first visited medical facilities within a mean time of 10.1(SD, 15.7) weeks after becoming aware of their illness, and a diagnosis was made at a mean of 27 (SD, 25) weeks. Non-Iraqw patients, especially the Datoga, practised drinking raw milk (35.2% 43/122), eating raw animal products (18.8% 24/128) and living in houses with poor ventilation (33.6% 44/131), more than Iraqw patients. Of the investigations done, 14.5% (60/415) were culture positive, 11.3% (16/142) were HIV positive, and 73.6% (128/174) had histological features consistent with tuberculosis. The knowledge of TB spread by air droplets was poorer in Iraqw (74.1%, 203/274) than in non-lraqw (61.1%, 77/126) patients. About 35.0% (45/129) of non-lraqw and 27.3% (79/289) of Iraqw patients were not aware that TB could be transmitted from animals to humans.

This study involved pregnant women aged 18-45 years old. In the delivery kit intervention population, the Maternal and Child Health Aide (MCHA) assigned to the health facility provided pregnant mothers with a clean delivery kit on their first antenatal visit. She explained how to use each of the kit components, with the aid of pictorial instructions included in the kit. The pregnant mothers were asked to convey the information to whoever assisted them during delivery. The MCHA also gave them health education based on the principles of the ""six cleans"" recognized by WHO (i.e., clean hands, clean perineum, clean delivery surface, clean cord cutting and tying instruments, clean cutting surface). Women received the clean delivery kit free of charge in accordance with the randomised stepped-wedge design schedule. During the first week following delivery, the Village Health Workers (VHWs) from both the intervention and control groups made two visits to the households of mothers who had delivered. They administered questionnaire about delivery to mother and birth attendant. During the two scheduled postpartum visits, those who were suspected to have puerperal sepsis or cord infection of the baby were referred to the health facility clinician for confirmation. Results indicated that use of clean delivery kit had a positive effect on reducing both cord infection and puerperal sepsis. The use of a clean home delivery kit coupled with an educational intervention about the ""six cleans"" had a significant effect on reducing the incidence of cord infection and puerperal sepsis among women enrolled in the study. In low resource settings where home birth is common and clean delivery supplies are scarce, disposable kits can be made available through health clinics, markets, pharmacies or other channels to help reduce rates of infection."

SP, the current drug of choice, is recommended to be administered in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy during antenatal care (ANC) visits. To allow for a proper design of planned scaling up of IPT services in Tanzania it is useful to understand the IPTp strategy's acceptability to health managers, ANC service providers and pregnant women. This study assesses the knowledge, attitudes and practices of these groups in relation to malaria control with emphasis on IPTp services. METHODS: The study was conducted in February 2004, in Korogwe District, Tanzania. It involved in-depth interviews with the district medical officer (DMO), district hospital medical officer in charge and relevant health service staff at two peripheral dispensaries, and separate focus group discussions (FGDs) with district Council Health Management Team members at district level and pregnant women at dispensary and community levels. RESULTS: Knowledge of malaria risks during pregnancy was high among pregnant women although some women did not associate coma and convulsions with malaria. Contacting traditional healers and self-medication with local herbs for malaria management was reported to be common. Pregnant women and ANC staff were generally aware of SP as the drug recommended for IPTp, albeit some nurses and the majority of pregnant women expressed concern about the use of SP during pregnancy. Some pregnant women testified that sometimes ANC staff allow the women to swallow SP tablets at home which gives a room for some women to throw away SP tablets after leaving the clinic. The DMO was sceptical about health workers' compliance with the direct observed therapy in administering SP for IPTp due to a shortage of clean water and cups at ANC clinics. Intensified sensitization of pregnant women about the benefits of IPTp was suggested by the study participants as an important approach for improving IPTp compliance. CONCLUSION: The successful implementation of the IPTp strategy in Tanzania depends on the proper planning of, and support to, the training of health staff and sustained sensitization of pregnant women at health facility and community levels about the benefits of IPTp for the women and their unborn babies."

As in many other countries, the translation of research evidence into drug policy action in Tanzania is often constrained by poor communication between researchers and policy decision-makers, individual perceptions or attitudes towards the drug and hesitation by some policy decision-makers to approve change when they anticipate possible undesirable repercussions should the policy change as proposed. Internationally, literature on the role of researchers on national antimalarial drug policy change is limited. To describe the (a) role of researchers in producing evidence that influenced the Tanzanian government replace chloroquine (CQ) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) as the first-line drug and the challenges faced in convincing policy-makers, general practitioners, pharmaceutical industry and the general public on the need for change (b) challenges ahead before a new drug combination treatment policy is introduced in Tanzania. In-depth interviews were held with national-level policy-makers, malaria control programme managers, pharmaceutical officers, general medical practitioners, medical research library and publications officers, university academicians, heads of medical research institutions and district and regional medical officers. Additional data were obtained through a review of malaria drug policy documents and participant observations were also done. In year 2001, the Tanzanian Government officially changed its malaria treatment policy guidelines whereby CQ--the first-line drug for a long time was replaced with SP. This policy decision was supported by research evidence indicating parasite resistance to CQ and clinical CQ treatment failure rates to have reached intolerable levels as compared to SP and amodiaquine (AQ). Research also indicated that since SP was also facing rising resistance trend, the need for a more effective drug was indispensable but for an interim 5-10 year period it was justifiable to recommend SP that was relatively more cost-effective than CQ and AQ. The government launched the policy change considering that studies (ethically approved by the Ministry of Health) on therapeutic efficacy and cost-effectiveness of artemisinin drug combination therapies were underway. Nevertheless, the process of communicating research results and recommendations to policy-making authorities involved critical debates between policy makers and researchers, among the researchers themselves and between the researchers and general practitioners, the speculative media reports on SP side-effects and reservations by the general public concerning the rationale for policy change, when to change, and to which drug of choice. Changing national drug policy will remain a sensitive issue that cannot be done overnight. However, to ensure that research findings are recognised and the recommendations emanating from such findings are effectively utilized, a systematic involvement of all the key stakeholders (including policy-makers, drug manufacturers, media, practitioners and the general public) at all stages of research is crucial. It also matters how and when research information is communicated to the stakeholders. Professional organizations such as the East African Network on Malaria Treatment have potential to bring together malaria researchers, policy-makers and other stakeholders in the research-to-drug policy change interface."

FINDINGS: Of 3158 children screened, 1811 were randomly assigned treatment and 1717 (95%) reached the 14-day follow-up. The amodiaquine group was stopped early by the data and safety monitoring board. By day 14, the parasitological failure rates were 103 of 248 (42%) for amodiaquine, 97 of 476 (20%) for amodiaquine+sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, 54 of 491 (11%) for amodiaquine+artesunate, and seven of 502 (1%) for artemether-lumefantrine. By day 28, the parasitological failure rates were 182 of 239 (76%), 282 of 476 (61%), 193 of 472 (40%), and 103 of 485 (21%), respectively. The difference between individual treatment groups and the next best treatment combination was significant (p<0.001) in every case. Recrudescence rates by day 28, after correction by genotyping, were 48.4%, 34.5%, 11.2%, and 2.8%, respectively.

Placental malaria may increase the susceptibility of infants to malaria parasitemia, but evidence for this effect is inconclusive.                                                                                    METHODS AND FINDINGS: During 2002-2004, we monitored parasitemia in 453 infants, including 69 who were born to mothers with placental malaria, in a region of northeastern Tanzania where malaria transmission is intense. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate the time from birth to first parasitemia, and a generalized estimating equations logistic regression model to evaluate risk of any parasitemia throughout the first year of life. Compared with infants whose mothers did not have placental malaria at delivery (""PM-negative""), offspring of mothers with placental malaria at delivery (""PM-positive"") were 41% more likely to experience their first parasitemia at a younger age (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.99). The odds of parasitemia throughout infancy were strongly modified by the interaction between placental malaria and gravidity (p for interaction = 0.008, Type 3 likelihood ratio test). Offspring of PM-negative primigravidae had lower odds of parasitemia during infancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.67, 95% CI 0.50-0.91) than offspring of PM-negative multigravidae, and offspring of PM-positive primigravidae had the lowest odds (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.09-0.47). In contrast, offspring of PM-positive multigravidae had significantly higher odds of parasitemia (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.16-2.17).                                                                                                                                                              CONCLUSION: Although parasitemia is more frequent in primigravid than multigravid women, the converse is true in their offspring, especially in offspring of PM-positive women. While placental malaria is known to increase mortality risk for first-born infants, it surprisingly reduced their risk of parasitemia in this study. Placental malaria of multigravidae, on the other hand, is a strong risk factor for parasitemia during infancy, and therefore preventive antimalarial chemotherapy administered to multigravid women close to term may reduce the frequency of parasitemia in their offspring"

This study was performed to investigate the distribution and levels of FasL and Fas in lymph node granulomas and sera of tuberculous lymphadenitis patients by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The validity of soluble Fas (sFas) or soluble FasL (sFasL) as a diagnostic tool was also examined. Levels of sFasL in serum were elevated among patients. The numbers of FasL stained cells in lymph node granulomas were higher than Fas. Children had significantly higher levels of sFasL as compared to adults. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-tuberculosis (TB)-coinfected patients displayed no differences in the levels of sFasL or sFas compared with HIV-negative patients. The healthy controls from a high endemic tuberculosis country (having latent TB) had significantly higher levels of sFasL than from a country with no TB transmission. The sensitivity and specificity of the FasL and Fas test were low when compared with the culture results as the gold standard. However, by using histology as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the FasL test were increased to 66.7% and 100%, respectively, but for the Fas test remained low. In conclusion, sFasL and sFas cannot be used as diagnostic tests for tuberculous lymphadenitis. However, its utility in detecting latent TB and childhood tuberculous lymphadenitis remains to be evaluated. FasL seems to play a role in immune modulation and pathogenesis of TB. Modulators of Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis may therefore be clinically useful."

Total 388 adults from Kome Islands (about 50 people from each village) aged between 12 and 85 years, were examined by abdominal ultrasound according to the Niamey protocol. Liver image patterns (LIPs) A and B were considered normal, and C-F as distinct periportal fibrosis (PPF). The overall prevalence of PPF was 42.2%; much higher in males than in females (47.0% in male vs 34.4% in females, P=0.007). Abnormal increase of segmental branch wall thickness (SBWT) and dilated portal vein diameter (PVD) were also more common in males than in females. Hepatosplenomegaly was frequently encountered; 68.1% had left liver lobe hepatomegaly and 55.2% had splenomegaly. Schistosoma mansoni-related morbidity is quite high among adults in this community justifying the implementation of integrated control strategies through mass drug administration, improved water supply (pumped wells), and health education that had already started in the study area."

Many of the currently available drugs for the treatment of these diseases face setbacks such as insufficient efficacy, increasing loss of effectiveness due to emergence of resistance, high levels of toxicity, inaccessibility and/or high costs. The driving force for drug discovery and development by pharmaceutical firms has been the foreseeable profit from drug sells. Since most infectious diseases prevail in developing countries and the fact that people living in these countries have poor purchasing power, the market for such drugs are unattractive to these firms. Thus, there has been reluctance for the pharmaceutical companies to engage in the development of drugs addressing diseases that mainly affect developing countries. Although a lot of research to discover new effective and cheap drugs is in progress in the disease endemic countries, it is not yet possible to fully develop leads and drug candidates from natural products, hence people in these countries continue to rely on traditional medicines. Poor economies and technological capabilities, lack of human resources and good management in these countries are the major constraints to progress in research and development work for new drugs. This paper discusses these major bottlenecks in drug discovery and development and suggests the way forward."

An understanding of the relationships among the level of exposure to Plasmodium falciparum, age, and severity of malaria can provide evidence of whether this is likely.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A total of 1984 patients admitted for severe malaria to 10 hospitals serving populations living at levels of transmission varying from very low (altitude >1200 m) to very high (altitude <600 m) in a defined area of northeastern Tanzania, studied prospectively from February 2002 to February 2003. Data were analyzed in a logistic regression model and adjusted for potential clustering within hospitals.

RESULTS: The median age of patients was 1 year in high transmission, 3 years in moderate transmission, and 5 years in low transmission areas. The odds of severe malarial anemia (hemoglobin <5 g/dL) peaked at 1 year of age at high transmission and at 2 years at moderate and low transmission intensities and then decreased with increasing age (P = .002). Odds were highest in infants (0-1 year: referent; 2-4 years: odds ratio [OR], 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72-0.96), 5 to <15 years: OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.72; > or =15 years: OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.73; P<.001) and high transmission intensity areas (altitude <600 m: referent; 600 m to 1200 m: OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.84; >1200 m: OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.26-1.15; P for trend = .03). The odds of cerebral malaria were significantly higher in low transmission intensity areas (altitude of residence <600 m: referent; 600 m to 1200 m: OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.32-7.60; >1200 m: OR, 3.76; 95% CI, 1.96-7.18; P for trend = .003) and with age 5 years and older (0-1 year: referent; 2-4 years: OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.82-2.99; 5 to <15 years: OR, 6.07; 95% CI, 2.98-12.38; > or =15 years: OR, 6.24; 95% CI, 3.47-11.21; P<.001). The overall case-fatality rate of 7% (139 deaths) was similar at high and moderate levels of transmission but increased to 13% in low transmission areas (P = .03), an increase explained by the increase in the proportion of cases with cerebral malaria.                                                                                         CONCLUSIONS: Age and level of exposure independently influence the clinical presentation of severe malaria. Our study suggests that an increase in the proportion of cases with more fatal manifestations of severe malaria is likely to occur only after transmission has been reduced to low levels where the overall incidence is likely to be low."

Mosquitoes were collected in light traps, from 50 randomly selected households in each community, once weekly for 1 year. They were identified, dissected and checked for parity and filarial larvae. Anopheles gambiae s. l., An. funestus and Culex quinquefasciatus transmitted W. bancrofti in the two communities but the importance of each of these taxa differed between the communities and by season. The overall vector densities and transmission intensities were significantly higher in Masaika than in Kingwede (the annual biting rate by 3.7 times and the annual transmission potential by 14.6 times), primarily because of differences in the available breeding sites for the vectors and in the vectorial capacity of the predominant vector species. A marked seasonal variation in vector abundance and transmission potential contributed to the complex transmission pattern in the communities. Generally, these indices were higher during and shortly after the rainy seasons than at other times of the year. Considerable differences in W. bancrofti transmission were thus observed between communities within a relatively small geographical area (mainly because of environmentally-determined differences in vector habitats), and these were reflected in the marked differences in infection level in the human populations. The variation in vector abundance, vector composition and transmission intensity in the two communities is discussed in respect to its cause, its effects, and its significance to those attempting to control bancroftian filariasis."

Half of these were also microfilariae (mf)-positive. Microfilaraemia decreased rapidly after onset of treatment and became undetectable after four treatments. Circulating antigenaemia also decreased progressively, but at a much slower rate. After two, four and eight treatment rounds, the mean CFA intensity was reduced by 81, 94 and 98%, and the prevalence of CFA positivity was 85, 66 and 57%, compared with pre-treatment, respectively. CFA clearance rates were negatively related to pre-treatment CFA intensities, and were higher among pre-treatment mf-negative individuals than among pre-treatment mf-positive individuals. Even among patients who had pre-treatment CFA intensities above the upper measuring level (32000antigen units), and who continued to have intensities above this level after treatment, a decrease in post-treatment CFA intensities was obvious from a continuous decrease in ELISA optical density values. Repeated DEC therapy thus appears to have a slow but profound and persistent macrofilaricidal effect, which in the long run may be beneficial to populations undergoing DEC-based control interventions by reducing the probability of future morbidity development."

Doxycycline treatment almost completely eliminated microfilaraemia at 8-14 months' follow-up (for all timepoints p<0.001). Ultrasonography detected adult worms in only six (22%) of 27 individuals treated with doxycycline compared with 24 (88%) of 27 with placebo at 14 months after the start of treatment (p<0.0001). At the same timepoint, filarial antigenaemia in the doxycycline group fell to about half of that before treatment (p=0.015).

Estimates of willingness to pay were compared across four drug combinations used to treat Tanzanian children with uncomplicated malaria. The reasons behind respondents' valuations and the effect of socioeconomic status on willingness to pay were explored. One hundred and eighty mothers whose children had been recruited into a recently completed randomized effectiveness trial of amodiaquine + artesunate (AQ+AS), amodiaquine + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ+SP), artemether-lumefantrine (coartemether) and amodiaquine monotherapy (AQ) were interviewed about their willingness to pay for these drugs two weeks after treatment. Estimates of willingness to pay were elicited with the bidding game technique. A significant difference was detected in the mean amounts respondents were willing to pay, with those who received AQ+AS willing to pay the most, followed by co-artemether, AQ+SP and finally AQ. The amounts patients' mothers were willing to pay for the artemisinin-based combinations, however, fell well short of the market costs. Socioeconomic status was not found to have a statistically significant effect on mean willingness to pay scores for any treatment group. This study shows that families who live in an area in which drug resistance to monotherapy is very high are willing to pay more for more effective artemisinin-based combination therapies. These amounts, however, are nowhere near the real costs of delivering the new drugs. Only with subsidies will artemisinin-based combination therapies realistically have any impact."

However, the census and household survey data that generally are used to produce estimates of child mortality do not permit precise measures of the adverse effect of HIV on child mortality. Methods: To calculate excess risks of child mortality as the result of maternal HIV status, we used pooled data from 3 longitudinal community-based studies that classified births by the mother's HIV status. We also estimated excess risks of child death caused by increased mortality among mothers. The joint effects of maternal HIV status and maternal survival were quantified using multivariate techniques in a survival analysis. Results: Our analysis shows that the excess risk of death associated with having an HIV-positive mother is 2.9 (95% confidence interval = 2.3-3.6), and this effect lasts throughout childhood. The excess risk associated with a maternal death is 3.9 (2.8-5.5) in the 2-year period centered on the mother's death, with children of both infected and uninfected mothers experiencing higher mortality risks at this time. Conclusion: HIV impacts on child mortality directly through transmission of the virus to newborns by infected mothers and indirectly through higher child mortality rates associated with a maternal death."

The IHRA, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and administered by the World Health Organization, recognized the need for us to find effective ways of solving our countries' health problems and acknowledged the special environmental constraints we face in conducting research and exploiting the results. We used this funding to explore alternative ways for harnessing largely untapped resources in our countries to generate and apply knowledge to improve people's health and address inequalities. In the Bangkok Declaration, we joined many others to express our commitment to research as a vital force for health of all of our people. Six of our ten projects explored, for particular themes or health topics, ways of extending the benefits of research to special groups or populations. Four more proposed specific approaches to consolidate national research policy and systems for allocating public research funds and managing research. From our collective reflection about what we have learned, we note ways in which our experiences represent change, particularly expansion of the traditional boundaries of research: –broadening the research agenda by adding new topics, more voices and more perspectives than has been the norm in our settings –expanding capacity to design and conduct research by preparing new groups of researchers to pose questions, design and carry out studies, and by engaging more partners and disciplines in addressing national priorities –extending dissemination of research results, especially by using websites and mass media to reach decision makers and broader segments of the public –encouraging uptake of research for policy and practice. We want research to improve the health of our societies' most disadvantaged groups and to engage them in the process. Our work benefited immeasurably from networks and other forms of collaboration that our grants helped to support—and supported to an extent that was unusual compared to other forms of research funding. We linked our national and regional collaborations to global efforts, but endeavored to do so without being driven or preempted by the latter. We are optimistic about the value of our experiences, but remain acutely aware of the unfinished agenda—an agenda that we incorporate into A CHALLENGE and A CALL for future action. We challenge ourselves, and others, to evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches to research for improving health systems and population health. We call on policy makers to adopt an evidence-based approach and to ensure that health systems are equipped to use rigorous research methods to embrace and analyze information from all participants. We close by asking donors and other international agencies for more flexible support so that we can benefit from global collaboration while maintaining our own priorities and building national and regional infrastructures to implement and evaluate new ways of doing research."

The data were collected from 1996 to 2003 in the Muheza district northeastern Tanzania. It covered household interviews with a stratified sample of 1,250 respondents, and in-depth interviews with all 175 health care providers in the 35 health facilities within the district. All six members of the district health management team were also interviewed. Additional data came from dispensary and hospital records, and published literature. The results show an unchanged malaria disease burden. The average number of clinical malaria episodes per child less than five years of age remained between 3 and 3.5 episodes per year in the district since the 1960s. The comparison of cases expected in the population less than five years old with those seen in the district health facilities shows a coverage rate of 33%. Furthermore, between 1990 and 2003, little training on malaria was provided to health staff. The findings imply a limited effectiveness of district health services on malaria control, suggesting a weak process of translating national malaria goals to activities at the district level."

In this area of unstable malaria, devastating epidemics are experienced at irregular intervals. Altitude plays a very important role in determining malaria transmission and infection. However, other landscape features may also influence this relationship. This research investigates whether the risk of malaria is related to the shape of the surrounding land, at various altitudes. We hypothesized that households situated close to flat areas where water is expected to accumulate, and are thus potential mosquitoes breeding sites, are at greater risk from malaria than those further away. Cross-sectional clinical surveys were carried out in seven villages along an altitudinal transect rising from 300 m to 1650 m in the western Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. Each village was mapped and incorporated within a geographical information system (GIS). Univariate analysis showed that the risk of an enlarged spleen was positively correlated with decreasing altitude. Other influential topographic variables identified were: water accumulation, flatness and swampiness. Logistic regression analysis produced two models and their equations were used in the GIS to map the risk of malaria infection within each village area. Model 1 included only altitude and correctly predicted the malaria status of 73% of households, whereas Model 2 incorporated altitude and the amount of swampiness within 400 m radius of each household to predict with 76% accuracy whether households were positive or not. We have identified that between 750 m and 1200 m, characteristics of the landscape play an important role in governing malaria risk. At these elevations malaria is highly unstable, and favourable meteorological conditions can cause malaria epidemics. This novel approach of exploring how topography affects the risk of malaria could be used to identify epidemic-prone areas m other African highland regions and help to improve the targeting of control activities in high-risk areas."

We compared plasma IL-12 and TGF-beta1 levels in groups of malaria patients categorized as uncomplicated, severe, cerebral and placental malaria. Both TGF-beta1 and IL-12 levels were significantly reduced in peripheral plasma of adults with severe and cerebral malaria as well as in plasma of Tanzanian children with cerebral malaria (P<0.05). Similar results were observed with both placental and peripheral plasma of pregnant women who were infected with Plasmodium falciparum. IL-18, a cytokine known to be critical for the induction of IFN-gamma along with IL-1, was produced more in uncomplicated adult patients than in aparasitimic healthy controls (P<0.05). However, IL-18 response rate declined as the symptoms of the disease became more severe suggesting that the IL-18 response may be impaired with increased malaria severity. Together, the results of the three cytokines support the notion that imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may contribute to the development of severe malaria infection. With malaria infection during pregnancy, we demonstrated that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) levels in infected placental plasma were significantly higher than those in the paired peripheral plasma (P<0.05). MIF, therefore, may play an important role in the local immune response to placental P. falciparum infection."

There was an overall significant increase in haemoglobin levels from day 0 to day 28 in both patient groups. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine produced an acceptable clinical response but the high degree of parasitological resistance (RII/RIII) observed two years prior to the introduction of the drug as first-line treatment is of concern, especially considering the long half-lives of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine."

At 8 weeks, 25% were sputum-smear positive but only 11% were culture-positive (P<0.0001). No significant differences were observed in culture conversion rate among those allocated to MMN or placebo (89.5 vs. 86.2%, P=0.29) at 8 weeks, although at week 4 those allocated to MMN had a slightly reduced culture conversion rate (42.8 vs. 52.8%, P=0.058). Zinc had no effects on culture conversion. MMN increased weight gain by 0.78 kg [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12--1.43] at week 8, while zinc supplementation had no effect. The effects of MMN and zinc did not interact and neither MMN nor zinc interacted with human immunodeficiency virus status, sex and culture-intensity at baseline. CONCLUSION: Neither zinc nor MMN supplementation had significant effects on culture conversion, but MMN supplementation increased weight gain in TB patients."

Surprisingly, even with the current renewed interest in malaria prevention and control and the enabling environment resulting from the Roll Back Malaria initiative and the political commitment made by the African Presidents at the Abuja Summit, there are still no significant initiatives for strengthening capacity for malaria control through training within the African continent itself. The Center for Enhancement of Effective Malaria Interventions (CEEMI) has been established in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania for results-oriented training. It is intended to provide the needed skills for identifying and solving malaria control problems and providing incentives to malaria control workers in their work performance. The intention is to produce implementers with leadership skills for planning and managing malaria control activities and who can use strategic thinking in improving their work performance. To sustain political commitment and support and to sensitize the community on malaria issues, the CEEMI, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (National Malaria Control Program), the Institute of Journalism and Mass Communication of the University of Dar es Salaam, and the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association have already conducted malaria seminars for Tanzanian Members of Parliament and journalists from Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda. Additionally, a diploma course in health communication is being developed for journalists and for the same purpose. Also being developed is a training module for ""Council Malaria Focal Person."" This is aimed at complementing the Roll Back Malaria initiative to meet the Abuja targets of reducing morbidity and mortality due to malaria by 50% by 2010."

Parasites causing severe malaria in nonimmune patients tend to express a restricted subset of VSA (VSA(SM)) that differs from VSA associated with uncomplicated malaria and asymptomatic infection (VSA(UM)). We compared var gene transcription in unselected P. falciparum clone 3D7 expressing VSA(UM) to in vitro-selected sublines expressing VSA(SM) to identify PfEMP1 responsible for the VSA(SM) phenotype. Expression of VSA(SM) was accompanied by up-regulation of Group A var genes. The most prominently up-regulated Group A gene (PFD1235w/MAL7P1.1) was translated into a protein expressed on the infected RBC surface. The proteins encoded by Group A var genes, such as PFD1235w/MAL7P1.1, appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of severe disease and are thus attractive candidates for a vaccine against life-threatening P. falciparum malaria."

METHODS: A 6-month longitudinal study monitoring risk factors for anaemia and febrile malaria episodes was conducted among individuals aged below 20 years, residing in three villages of different altitude in areas of high, moderate and low malaria transmission intensity in North-Eastern Tanzania. RESULTS: The burden of anaemia and malarial fever fell mainly on the youngest children and was highest in the village with high transmission intensity. Although a considerable percentage of individuals in all villages carried intestinal worms, logistic regression models indicated that Plasmodium falciparum was the only significant parasitic determinant of anaemia. Interestingly, children who carried low-density parasitaemia at the start of the study had a lower risk of contracting a febrile malaria episode but a higher risk of anaemia during the study period, than children who were slide negative at this point in time. CONCLUSION: Young children living in the high transmission village carried a very high anaemia burden, which could be attributed to malaria. The overall incidence of febrile malaria was also highest in the high transmission village particularly among those under five years of age. These data suggest that in rolling back malaria, available resources in prevention programmes should primarily be focussed on young children, particularly those residing in areas of high malaria transmission."

Being found microfilaraemic in the first survey was a highly significant risk factor for being found microfilaraemic in the subsequent surveys. These observations strongly indicate that re-infection with Wuchereria bancrofti commonly takes place, and that, compared with an individual who has never been infected, an individual who has been infected in the past has a much higher chance of acquiring a new, detectable infection. As most of the re-identified individuals who were amicrofilaraemic in 2001 but microfilaraemic in one or both of the earlier surveys were still positive for circulating filarial antigens in 2001, it seems that, once an infection has been acquired, the chance of ever becoming free of infection is small. No relationship between past microfilaraemia and the development of chronic filariasis was observed but the number of clinical cases seen in 2001, among the re-identified individuals, was low. The significance of these findings to our understanding of the natural history of W. bancrofti infection is discusse"

The strategies were the standard 12 day treatment (strategy I); a semi-annual single-dose treatment (strategy II); and a monthly low-dose treatment (strategy III). Treatment was given only during the first year. Following reductions immediately after treatment, overall community microfilaraemia levels were approaching pre-treatment levels in all three communities, 10 years later. In individuals who were microfilaria-positive and treated at baseline, the treatment had a long-term effect on microfilarial intensities, with geometric mean intensities being only 11%, 13% and 2% of pre-treatment levels 10 years later for strategies I, II and III, respectively. This suppressive effect was most pronounced for strategy III, which also cleared microfilaraemia and circulating filarial antigenaemia in a larger proportion of treated individuals than the other strategies. Most of the follow-up individuals who developed microfilaraemia between 2 and 10 years after start of treatment had also been microfilaraemic before treatment, suggesting that reappearance of microfilaraemia may be due to surviving female worms and/or that previously microfilaraemic individuals have a higher chance of reinfection than previously amicrofilaraemic individuals."

Design: Cross sectional involving comparison analysis of high-risk groups. Setting: Seven hospitals in rural and semi-rural districts of Arusha. Subjects: The study comprised of 457 patients of clinically diagnosed mycobacterial adenitis. Interventions: Biopsy materials were cultured and identification of mycobacterial isolates, and HIV infection testing were performed using standard methods. A questionnaire was used to establish information for assessing risk factors. Main outcome measures: Proportions of mycobacterial isolates, risk factors and odds ratios. Results: Of the 457 specimens, 65(14.2%) were culture positive. Isolates identified were M. bovis, 7(10.8%) M. tuberculosis, 27(41.5%) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria 31(47.7%). HIV infection and ingestion of raw milk were linked with increased risk of M. bovis infection by OR of 13.6 (95% CI, 1.7 - 109.9) and 15.28 (3.26 - 71.7), respectively. On multivariate analysis, an OR of 16.2 (1.3 - 201.3) for having M. bovis adenitis was linked to HIV infection, raw milk and houses with poor ventilation. An OR of 5.2 (1.2 - 20.6) for non-tuberculous mycobacterial adenitis was linked to history of TB in the family, HIV infection, raw milk, raw animal products and poor knowledge on transmission of tuberculosis. Conclusions: M. bovis caused one out of ten cases of culture positive mycobacterial adenitis. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were more common than M. tuberculosis (50% and 40% of the cases, respectively). HIV infection and raw animal products are among the risk factors identified for M. bovis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial adenitis."

Tanzania Health Research Bulletin 6, 57-63.",Challenges of implementing Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response strategy using the current Health Management Information System in Tanzania,Health Management Information System,Tanzania Health Research Bulletin,2004,6,,57,57,7,,,,,,,,,"Tanzania adopted an Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy in 1998 in order to strengthen its infectious disease surveillance system. During that time, the country had 5 separate surveillance systems to monitor infectious disease trends and disease control programmes. The systems included the Health Management Information System (HMIS); Infectious Disease Week Ending; Tuberculosis/Leprosy; Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; and Acute Flaccid Paralysis/Poliomyelitis). An assessment of the surveillance systems in the country has shown inadequacy in the use of standard case definitions and laboratory confirmation of cases, supervision and feedback as well as data collection tools. Moreover, in some of the existing vertical disease surveillance programmes, the epidemiological data generated were neither fully analyzed nor utilized at district level, but rather were forwarded to higher levels, which hardly provided any feedback to the lower levels. For these and other reasons, the Ministry of Health adopted the IDSR strategy that will focus on selected priority diseases. Although a significant progress has been made as far as the IDSR strategy is concerned, its implementation is facing several challenges. This is due to the fact that the current surveillance system has to utilize the existing HMIS system in collecting and compiling epidemiological data from health facility and district levels. This paper intends to discuss in detail challenges, which the Ministry of Health and district councils have to take into consideration during the implementation of IDSR strategy. Recommendations are also made for possible adoption to enable smooth running of the IDSR strategy at the national, district and facility levels. "

Yet, it is still not known whether the WHO-recommended primary strategy of applying annual single-dose mass chemotherapy with a combination of two drugs for 4-6 years will effectively break parasite transmission from all endemic communities. Here we review recent work on the development and application of a deterministic mathematical model of filariasis transmission, to show how models of parasite transmission will help resolve the key currently debated questions regarding the ultimate effectiveness of the global strategy to control filariasis. These critical questions include the required duration of mass treatment in different endemic areas, the optimal drug coverage required to meet control targets within prescribed timeframes, the impact and importance of adding vector control to mass chemotherapy regimens, and the likelihood of the development of drug resistance by treated worm populations. The results demonstrate the vital role that integrating these models into control programming can have in providing effective decision-support frameworks for undertaking the optimal design and monitoring of regional and global filariasis-control programmes. Operationally, the models show that the effectiveness of the strategy to achieve filariasis control will be determined by successfully addressing two key factors: the need to maintain high community treatment coverages, and the need to include vector control measures especially in areas of high endemicity."

The variant surface antigens (VSA) that mediate parasite adhesion to a range of host molecules are regarded as important targets of acquired protective immunity, but their diversity makes them questionable vaccine candidates. We determined levels of VSA-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in human plasma collected at four geographically distant and epidemiologically distinct localities with specificity for VSA expressed by P. falciparum isolates from three African countries. Plasma levels of VSA-specific IgG recognizing individual parasite isolates depended on the transmission intensity at the site of plasma collection but were largely independent of the geographical origin of the parasites. The total repertoire of immunologically distinct VSA thus appears to be finite and geographically conserved, most likely due to functional constraints. Furthermore, plasma samples frequently had high IgG reactivity to VSA expressed by parasites isolated more than 10 years later, showing that the repertoire is also temporally stable. Parasites from patients with severe malaria expressed VSA (VSASM) that were better recognized by plasma IgG than VSA expressed by other parasites, but importantly, VSASM-type antigens also appeared to show substantial antigenic homogeneity. Our finding that the repertoire of immunologically distinct VSA in general, and in particular that of VSASM, is geographically and temporally conserved raises hopes for the feasibility of developing VSA-based vaccines specifically designed to accelerate naturally acquired immunity, thereby enhancing protection against severe and life-threatening P. falciparum malaria."

Partnerships between communities and academic ecologists can address this capacity deficit, modernize the evidence base for such approaches and enable future scale up. Community-based IVM programmes were initiated in two contrasting settings. On Rusinga Island, Western Kenya, community outreach to a marginalized rural community was achieved by University of Nairobi through a community-based organization. In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Ilala Municipality established an IVM programme at grassroots level, which was subsequently upgraded and expanded into a pilot scale Urban Malaria Control Programme with support from national academic institutes. Both programmes now access relevant expertise, funding and policy makers while the academic partners benefit from direct experience of community-based implementation and operational research opportunities. The communities now access up-to-date malaria-related knowledge and skills for translation into local action. Similarly, the academic partners have acquired better understanding of community needs and how to address them. Until sufficient evidence is provided, community-based IVM remains an operational research activity. Researchers can never directly support every community in Africa so community based IVM strategies and tactics will need to be incorporated into undergraduate teaching programmes to generate sufficient numbers of practitioners for national scale programmes. Academic ecologists at African institutions are uniquely positioned to enable the application of practical environmental and entomological skills for malaria control by communities at grassroots level and should be supported to fulfil this neglected role."

By citing evidence on similar experience from other developing countries, this paper presents, although in descriptive form, findings from technical research reports based on recent studies in Tanzania and critically analyses the relationship between government policy and its translation into practice. Evidence from previous but recent local studies indicates that while the policy explicitly identifies people with certain medical conditions as vulnerable groups eligible for exemptions, the issue of ‘waivers’ has been left to be decided at the discretion of local community leaders and health workers on ground that they know better the lifestyles, backgrounds and health conditions of the people surrounding them. This was viewed as a way of decentralizing decisions to local government authorities in granting such mechanisms to eligible people at the existing rates of health-care payments. This policy failure to define ‘who are the poor’ or how the poor should be assessed has caused confusion among health-care providers in identifying people who are eligible for waivers. It has also been used as a loophole for some health administrators to ignore people who deserve waivers since some people eligible for exemptions or waivers still pay either directly at the counter or indirectly under the table in order to get the better services they need. Other people delay or fail to contact health facilities due to lack of money or by avoiding the institutional bureaucracy in confirming who deserves a waiver. Some people do not benefit from exemptions because of lack of knowledge if they qualify and/or the procedures for presenting their claims. Meanwhile some exemptions are granted to people other than the targeted vulnerable groups. On the other hand, health workers hesitate to approve exemptions and waivers to avoid losing revenue on the side of their health facilities. Additional findings, discussions, conclusion and recommendations are presented."

However, despite extensive literature on the topic, little is known about the processes and results of decentralization, including the relationship with the control of major public health problems caused by communicable diseases. This paper reports from a study of decentralization and control of tropical diseases in districts implementing health sector and local government reforms in Tanzania. The study was undertaken in four districts, involving interviews and discussions with key stakeholders from individual household members to the district commissioner, and a review of official health policy, planning and management documents. The study findings reveal devolution of financial, planning and managerial authority being theoretical rather than practical, as district health plans are largely directed by national and international priorities rather than by local priorities. Vertical programmes still exist, focusing narrowly on single diseases. The local mechanisms for multisectoral collaboration, as well as community participation functions, are far from optimal. Further, inappropriate and weak information systems prevent adequate local responsiveness in setting priorities. In conclusion, decentralization might have a large potential for improving health system performance, but problems of implementation pose serious challenges to releasing this potential."

Nevertheless, the large-scale use of such materials is constrained by demand and supply factors. The contemporary debate is that people might be willing to pay for bednets but their short supply could constrain their actual use. Also it is concerned that supplying bednets in the market is one thing but whether people are prepared to purchase them is another thing since the actual uptake of bednets is determined by personal or household's disposable income, and their prices, their shapes and sizes as well as people's attitudes. This paper reports on a study of willingness to pay (WTP) for Olyset bednets among formal employees and villagers predominantly engaged in subsistence farming in Korogwe and Muheza districts in Tanzania. Generally, the study found that, fixing a price of Tshs. 3,500 or more per one bednet to be paid at once is practically undesirable to many peasants even if the majority of them might have stated their WTP that price. On the other hand, allowing prepayments or payments by instalments has the advantage of promoting sales and utilization of bednets among formal and informal employees. The study recommends demand creation mechanisms like social marketing towards changing public perceptions and attitudes for better utilization of bednets."

Lack of diagnostic and curative services at the government health care facilities was common, but there was a willingness from the biomedical health care services to collaborate with the traditional healers. Recommendations to the District Health Management Team were: that collaboration between biomedical and traditional health care providers should be strengthened and that the government facilities' diagnostic and curative capacity with regard to schistosomiasis should be upgraded. Culturally compatible health education programmes should be developed in collaboration with the local community."

The variant surface antigens (VSA) that mediate parasite adhesion to a range of host molecules are regarded as important targets of acquired protective immunity, but their diversity makes them questionable vaccine candidates. We determined levels of VSA-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in human plasma collected at four geographically distant and epidemiologically distinct localities with specificity for VSA expressed by P. falciparum isolates from three African countries. Plasma levels of VSA-specific IgG recognizing individual parasite isolates depended on the transmission intensity at the site of plasma collection but were largely independent of the geographical origin of the parasites. The total repertoire of immunologically distinct VSA thus appears to be finite and geographically conserved, most likely due to functional constraints. Furthermore, plasma samples frequently had high IgG reactivity to VSA expressed by parasites isolated more than 10 years later, showing that the repertoire is also temporally stable. Parasites from patients with severe malaria expressed VSA (VSASM) that were better recognized by plasma IgG than VSA expressed by other parasites, but importantly, VSASM-type antigens also appeared to show substantial antigenic homogeneity. Our finding that the repertoire of immunologically distinct VSA in general, and in particular that of VSASM, is geographically and temporally conserved raises hopes for the feasibility of developing VSA-based vaccines specifically designed to accelerate naturally acquired immunity, thereby enhancing protection against severe and life-threatening P. falciparum malaria."

An assessment of the quality of sexual partnership reporting in rural Tanzania,sexual partnership,Social Science and Medicine,2004,59,2,299,310,5,,,,,,,,,"In population-based surveys on sexual behaviour, men consistently report higher numbers of sexual partners than women, which may be associated with male exaggeration or female under-reporting or with issues related to sampling, such as exclusion of female sex workers. This paper presents an analysis of data collected in the context of a longitudinal study in rural Tanzania, where a sexual partnership module was applied to all participating men and women in the study population. Since the study design included all men and women of reproductive ages and did not involve sampling, these data provide a unique opportunity to compare the consistency of aggregate measures of sexual behaviour between men and women living in the same villages. The analysis shows that non-marital partnerships were common amongst single people of both sexes--around 70% of unmarried men and women report at least one sexual partner in the last year. However, 40% of married men also report having non-marital partners, but only 3% of married women did so. Single women reported about half as many multiple partnerships in the last year as men. Under-reporting of non-marital partnerships was much more common among single women than among married women and men. Furthermore, women were more likely to report longer duration partnerships and partnership with urban men or more educated men than with others. If a woman reports multiple partners, biological data indicate that she is at high risk of contracting HIV. For men, however, there is only a weak association between number of partnerships and the risk of HIV, and it cannot be excluded that men, especially single men, exaggerate the number of sexual partners."

Only 58% of males and 29% of females with biological markers consistently reported sexual activity in both questionnaires. Nine of 11 (82%) in-depth interview respondents who had had biological markers provided an invalid series of responses about sex in the survey and in-depth interview series. Only one of six female in-depth interview respondents with an STI reported sex in any of the four surveys, but five reported it in the in-depth interviews.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  CONCLUSION: In this low prevalence population, biological markers on their own revealed that a few adolescents had had sex, but in combination with in-depth interviews they may be useful in identifying risk factors for STIs. Self-reported sexual behavior data were fraught with inconsistencies. In-depth interviews seem to be more effective than assisted self-completion questionnaires and face to face questionnaires in promoting honest responses among females with STIs. Participant observation was the most useful method for understanding the nature, complexity, and extent of sexual behavior."

Prospective observational study of children and adults over the course a year. 10 hospitals in north east Tanzania. 17,313 patients were admitted to hospital; of these 4474 (2851 children aged under 5 years) fulfilled criteria for severe disease. Details of the treatment given and outcome. Altitudes of residence (a proxy for transmission intensity) measured with a global positioning system. Blood film microscopy showed that 2062 (46.1%) of people treated for malaria had Plasmodium falciparum (slide positive). The proportion of slide positive cases fell with increasing age and increasing altitude of residence. Among 1086 patients aged > or = 5 years who lived above 600 metres, only 338 (31.1%) were slide positive, while in children < 5 years living in areas of intense transmission (< 600 metres) most (958/1392, 68.8%) were slide positive. Among 2375 people who were slide negative, 1571 (66.1%) were not treated with antibiotics and of those, 120 (7.6%) died. The case fatality in slide negative patients was higher (292/2412, 12.1%) than for slide positive patients (142/2062, 6.9%) (P < 0.001). Respiratory distress and altered consciousness were the strongest predictors of mortality in slide positive and slide negative patients and in adults as well as children. In Tanzania, malaria is commonly overdiagnosed in people presenting with severe febrile illness, especially in those living in areas with low to moderate transmission and in adults. This is associated with a failure to treat alternative causes of severe infection. Diagnosis needs to be improved and syndromic treatment considered. Routine hospital data may overestimate mortality from malaria by over twofold."

We carried out a survey in an endemic Tanzanian village to investigate this phenomenon. Individuals who were positive in the NOW Filariasis test at 10 min after specimen application were also positive in the TropBio ELISA for CFA, and thus appeared to be truly positive. Many of the test cards that were negative at 10 min developed a positive line later, but these lines appeared to be falsely positive when the TropBio test was used as the gold standard. Close examination revealed that true and false positivity lines could be distinguished on their shape and colour. The study thus reaffirmed that test cards should be read after 10 min to avoid false positives, but it also indicated that experienced test card users should be able to make a correct diagnosis even at a later time"

A randomized double-blind field trial with a single dose of ivermectin (150–200 ?g/kg body weight) alone or in combination with albendazole (400 mg) was subsequently carried out among these children. Both treatment regimens resulted in a considerable decrease in mean mf intensities, with overall reductions being slightly but statistically significantly higher for the combination than for ivermectin alone. The difference in effect between the two treatment regimens was most pronounced at 6 months, whereas it was minor at 12 months after treatment. The relative effect of treatment on mean CFA units was less pronounced than on mf. For both treatment regimens, reductions in CFA intensity appeared to be higher in children who were both CFA and mf positive before treatment, which may suggest that treatment mainly affected the survival and/or production of mf, rather than the survival of adult worms. New cases of infection appeared after treatment with both regimens among the pre-treatment mf and CFA negative children. Adverse reactions were few and mild in both groups, and mainly reported from pre-treatment mf and CFA positive children. The alarmingly high prevalence of W. bancrofti infection in primary school children highlights the importance of also determining the reversibility of already acquired early lesions, and the development of new measures and strategies to specifically protect children from later developing clinical disease."

Human infection was monitored by repeated cross-sectional surveys, and transmission by weekly light trap collection of vector mosquitoes in selected houses in each community. Treatments resulted in a progressive decrease in microfilaremia and circulating antigenemia in both communities, with relative reductions being considerably higher for mf than for CFA. Among pretreatment mf-positive individuals, more than 60% were diagnosed as mf negative and mean mf intensities were reduced by 99% in both communities after two treatment rounds. In contrast, only moderate reductions were seen in circulating antigenemia among pretreatment CFA-positive individuals, with mean intensities still being 24-39% of pretreatment values after two treatment rounds. Among the pretreatment mf/CFA-positive individuals, clearance to a CFA-negative status was negligible. Complete CFA clearance was only observed among pretreatment CFA-positive but mf negative individuals who also had much lower initial mean CFA levels than the mf-positive individuals. After treatment, the intensity of transmission decreased in the high-endemicity community, but this appeared mainly to be a consequence of a drought-induced reduction in vector density rather than to reduced mf load in the human population, since the proportion of mosquitoes carrying infective larvae was not reduced. No change in transmission or mosquito infectivity was observed after treatment in the low-endemicity community. Implications of these observations for the control of Bancroftian filariasis are discussed."

To address this possible source of error, we used an 8?locus microsatellite system to identify the source of bloodmeals of Anopheles gambiaes.l. and A. funestus mosquitoes collected in rooms and window traps in Tanzanian villages with and without nets treated with alphacypermethrin. DNA fingerprints were produced from blood samples taken from people who had slept in these rooms and were matched to fingerprints obtained from the mosquito bloodmeals. We were able to type successfully over 90% of the bloodmeals collected and found that proportions of bloodfed mosquitoes that had fed on occupants of the rooms in which they were found were high and only slightly greater in villages without treated nets than those with them (95% and 88%, respectively). When these percentages were used to adjust estimates of personal protection, it was found that the error due to mosquitoes not feeding in the rooms in which they were collected is negligible."

Olyset nets are currently one of two long-lasting insecticidal nets recommended by WHO. An assessment was carried out of the effect of Olyset nets after seven years of use in rural Tanzania. A survey of Olyset nets was conducted in two Tanzanian villages to examine their insecticide dosage, bioassay efficacy and desirability compared with ordinary polyester nets. Of 103 randomly selected nets distributed in 1994 to 1995, 100 could be traced. Most nets were in a condition likely to offer protection against mosquito biting. Villagers appreciated mainly the durability of Olyset trade mark nets and insecticide persistence. People disliked the small size of these nets and the light blue colour and preferred a smaller mesh size, features that can easily be modified. At equal price, 51% said they would prefer to buy an Olyset net and 49% opted for an ordinary polyester net. The average permethrin content was 33%-41% of the initial insecticide dose of 20,000 mg/Kg. Bioassay results indicated high knock-down rates at 60 minutes, but the mosquito mortality after 24 hours was rather low (mean: 34%). No significant correlation was found between bioassay results and insecticide concentration in and on the net. Olyset nets are popular, durable and with a much longer insecticide persistence than ordinary polyester nets. Hence, Olyset nets are one of the best choices for ITN programmes in rural malaria-endemic areas."

Reliable data on the sexual health of adolescents are needed to guide the development of such interventions. The aim was to describe the sexual health of pupils in years 4 to 6 of 121 rural primary schools in north western Tanzania, before the implementation of an innovative sexual health intervention in 58 of the schools. METHODS: A cross sectional survey of primary school pupils in rural Tanzania was carried out. The study population comprised pupils registered in years 4 to 6 of 121 primary schools in 20 rural communities in 1998. Basic demographic information was collected from all pupils seen. Those born before 1 January 1985 (aged approximately 14 years and over) were invited to participate in the survey, and asked about their knowledge and attitudes towards sexual health issues, and their sexual experience. A urine specimen was requested and tested for HIV, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and, for females, pregnancy. RESULTS: 9283 pupils born before 1 January 1985 were enrolled and provided demographic information and a urine sample. Male pupils were significantly older than females (mean age 15.5 years v 14.8 years, p<0.001), but all other demographic characteristics were similar between the sexes. 14 (0.2%) of the enrolled pupils (four male and 10 female) were HIV positive, 83 (0.9%) were positive for CT, and 12 (0.1%) for NG. 32 female pupils (0.8%) were positive by pregnancy test. Sexual experience was reported by one fifth of primary school girls, and by almost half of boys. Only 45/114 (39%) girls with biological markers of sexual activity reported having had sex. CONCLUSIONS: HIV, CT, NG, and pregnancy were present though at relatively low levels among pupils in years 4 to 6 of primary school. A high proportion of pupils with a biological marker of sexual activity denied ever having had sex. Alternative ways of collecting sensitive data about the sexual behaviour of school pupils should be explored."

Malaria epidemics occur when weather conditions favour this vector borne disease. Forecasting using the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may assist in anticipating epidemics and reducing the impact of a disease which is an important cause of low birthweight. The aim of the present study was to determine the impact of the malaria epidemic in East Africa during 1997-1998 on birthweights in two different areas of Tanzania and to explore ESNO's potential for forecasting low birthweight risk in pregnant women.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    METHOD: A retrospective analysis of birthweight differences between primigravidae and multigravidae in relation to malaria cases and rainfall for two different areas of Tanzania: Kagera, which experiences severe outbreaks of malaria, and Morogoro which is holoendemic. Birthweight and parity data and malaria admissions were collected over a 10-year period from two district hospitals in these locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   RESULTS: The risk of delivering a low birthweight baby in the first pregnancy increases approximately 5 months following a malaria epidemic. An epidemic of marked reduced birthweight in primigravidae compared with multigravidae occurred, related to the ENSO of 1997-1998. In Kagera this birthweight difference and the risk of low birthweight were significantly lower compared with Morogoro, except after the ENSO when the two areas had similar differences. No significant interaction was noted between secundigravidae and any of the risk periods. The results indicate that the pressure of malaria is much greater on pregnant women, especially primigravidae, living in the Morogoro location.                                 CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance of birthweight differences between primigravidae and multigravidae is a useful indicator of malaria exposure."

Large-scale screening of the prevalence of these mutations could facilitate the surveillance of the level of S/P resistance in vivo. The prevalence of mutations in dhfr and dhps in relation to S/P efficacy was studied in four sites of differing endemicity in Sudan, Mozambique, and Tanzania. The sites were organized in order of increasing resistance and a significant increase in the prevalence of triple mutations in codons c51, c59, and c108 of dhfr was observed. A similar trend was observed when dhfr genotypes were combined with c437 of dhps. Since the differences in S/P resistance between the sites were minor, but nevertheless revealed major differences in dhfr genotype prevalence, the role of dhfr as a general molecular marker seems debatable. The differences may reflect variation in the duration and magnitude of S/P usage (or other antifolate drugs) between the sites. Thus, triple dhfr mutations may prove suitable only as a general guideline for detecting emerging S/P resistance in areas where S/P has been introduced recently. However, changes in susceptibility within the same area with moderate levels of resistance may be possible by longitudinal surveillance of a subset of dhfr/dhps mutations that has been associated with S/P resistance in vivo in a defined location. "

In December 1998, Magoda received insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), whereas ITNs were introduced in Mpapayu in March 2001. We have studied the effect of ITNs on P. falciparum resistance genes by monitoring the prevalence of dhfr and dhps genotypes in children less than five years old living in the villages from 1998 to 2000. In 2000, after two years of bed net use, the prevalence of wild types in codon 51, 59, and 108 of dhfr increased significantly in Magoda compared with previous years. Furthermore, the prevalence of dhfr wild types was significantly higher in Magoda than in Mpapayu in 2000. The impact of ITNs on the transmission intensity seems not only to affect the overall malaria morbidity, but may even facilitate restoration of susceptibility to antimalarial drugs."

This is surprising because many parts of the highlands were considered too cold to support transmission. In this report, we examined how transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in six villages changed along an altitude transect in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania, from 300 m to 1700 m. Routine entomological collections were made using spray catches and light traps for 15 mo. Direct estimates of entomological inoculation rates and indirect estimates of vectorial capacity suggested a >1000-fold reduction in transmission intensity between the holoendemic lowland and the hypoendemic highland plateau. Lowland transmission was perennial with a significant peak in the cool season after the long rains in May, when vectors densities were high. In the highlands, low temperatures prevented parasite development in mosquitoes during the cool season rains, and highland transmission was therefore limited to the warm dry season when vector densities were low. The primary effect of increasing altitude was a log-linear reduction in vector abundance and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in the proportion of infective mosquitoes. Highland malaria transmission was maintained at extraordinarily low vector densities. We discuss herein the implications of these findings for modeling malaria and suggest that process-based models of malaria transmission risk should be improved by considering the direct effect of temperature on vector densities. Our findings suggest that variation in the short rains in November and changes in agricultural practices are likely to be important generators of epidemics in the Usambaras."

The goal was to identify factors that could explain differences in the spread of HIV within sub-Saharan African populations. Ecologic comparison of data from population-based surveys in high and relatively low HIV prevalence rural areas in Zimbabwe, Manicaland, and Tanzania, Kisesa. HIV prevalence in Manicaland and Kisesa was 15.4% and 5.3% in men aged 17-44 years and 21.1% and 8.0% in women aged 15-44 years (odds ratios, 3.3 and 3.1, respectively). Marriage is later, spatial mobility more common, cohabitation with marital partners less frequent, education levels are higher, and male circumcision is less common in Manicaland. However, adjustment for differences in these factors increased the odds ratios for HIV infection in Manicaland versus Kisesa to 6.9 and 4.8 for men and women, respectively. Sexually transmitted infection levels were similar, but syphilis was only common in Kisesa. Respondents in Kisesa started sex earlier and reported more sexual partners. Age differences between partners were similar in the 2 locations. Substantial differences exist between the contemporary sociodemographic profiles of rural Manicaland and Kisesa. However, these differences did not translate into measurable differences in the biologic or behavioral factors for which data were available and did not explain the much higher HIV prevalence found in Manicaland. These findings might reflect more extensive AIDS-selective mortality and behavior change or greater bias in reporting of sexual behavior in Zimbabwe."

METHODS: Cross sectional surveys were conducted in adults aged 16-54 years from different sectors of communities neighboring two newly opened, large scale gold mines near Lake Victoria. Mine workers, men, women, and female food and recreational facility workers (FRFW) from the community were randomly selected for interview and HIV and STI testing.               RESULTS: 207 male Tanzanian mine workers, 206 FRFW, 202 other male and 205 female community members were enrolled. Overall, 42% of FRFW were HIV positive, compared to 6% of male mine workers, and 16% and 18% of other community men and women respectively. HIV prevalence in FRFW was significantly associated with alcohol consumption (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 5.5), past or present syphilis (TPPA+) (aOR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 5.1) and single status (aOR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 11.9). Among FRFW, 24% had active syphilis (RPR+, TPPA+), 9% Chlamydia trachomatis, and 4% Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Overall, 50% of FRFW and 50% of community men never used condoms during sex, and 55% mineworkers, 61% male, and 20% female community members reported receiving/giving payment for sex during the previous year.                                                                                      CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of HIV and other STIs in communities around new goldmines in Tanzania, especially in FRFW. HIV and STI prevalence in the mining workforce is still relatively low, but high risk sexual behaviour is reported by all adult subgroups surveyed in this study. Programmes focusing on HIV/STI prevention, with targeted interventions for high risk women such as FRFW, will be extremely important in such high transmission communities where there is substantial recent in-migration of men and women seeking work. Such programmes have recently been initiated by a private/public/NGO partnership."

We do not accept the view that scaling-up this method should be by making villagers pay for nets and insecticide, with subsidies limited so as not to discourage the private sector. We consider that ITNs should be viewed as a public good, like vaccines, and should be provided via the public sector with generous assistance from donors. Our experience is that teams distributing free ITNs, replacing them after about 4 years when they are torn and retreating them annually, have high productivity and provide more comprehensive and equitable coverage than has been reported for marketing systems. Very few of the free nets are misused or sold. The estimated cost would be an annual expenditure of about US$295 million to provide for all of rural tropical Africa where most of the world's malaria exists. This expenditure is affordable by the world community as a whole, but not by its poorest members. Recently, funding of this order of magnitude has been committed by donor agencies for malaria control."

Island men reported fewer sexual partners than mainland men but no differences were found for women. Island men were more likely to be circumcised, island women less mobile and there were differences in marriage patterns. Possible explanations for the differences in HIV and syphilis include: slower introduction of HIV into the islands because of geographical isolation, more core-group sexual contact on the mainland, higher prevalence of male circumcision on the islands and differences in marital status. Differences in transmission dynamics may lead to geographical patterns that vary between STIs."

We compared the safety and efficacy of albendazole (400 mg) in combination with ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg), for the treatment of co-infections of Wuchereria bancrofti and Onchocerca volvulus with single infection of W. bancrofti. METHODS: The safety study on co-infections was a crossover, double blind design, while for the single infection of bancroftian filariasis an open design comparing two treatments was used. For co-infection, one group was allocated a single dose of ivermectin (150 micrograms/kg) plus albendazole (400 mg) (Group A). The other group received placebo (Group B). Five days later the treatment regime was reversed, with the Group A receiving placebo and Group B receiving treatment. For the single bancroftian filariasis infection, one group received a single dose of albendazole (400 mg) plus ivermectin (150 microg/kg) (Group C) while the other group received a single dose of albendazole (400 mg) alone (Group D). Blood and skin specimens were collected on admission day, day 0, and on days 2, 3, and 7 to assess drug safety and efficacy. Thereafter, blood and skin specimens were collected during the 12 months follow up for the assessment of drug efficacy. Study individuals were clinically monitored every six hours during the first 48 hours following treatment, and routine clinical examinations were performed during the hospitalisation period and follow-up. RESULTS: In individuals co-infected with bancroftian filariasis and onchocerciasis, treatment with ivermectin and albendazole was safe and tolerable. Physiological indices showed no differences between groups with co-infection (W. bancrofti and O. volvulus) or single infection (W. bancrofti). The frequency of adverse events in co-infected individuals was 63% (5/8, Group A, albendazole + ivermectin) and 57% (4/7, Group B, placebo) and of mild or moderate intensity. In single W. bancrofti infection the frequency of adverse events was 50% (6/12, Group C, albendazole + ivermectin) and 38% (5/13, Group D, albendazole) and of a similar intensity to those experienced with co-infection. There were no differences in adverse events between treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the reduction of microfilaraemia following treatment with albendazole and ivermectin in groups with single or co-infection. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that ivermectin plus albendazole is a safe and tolerable treatment for co-infection of bancroftian filariasis and onchocerciasis."

Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to most affordable antimalarial drugs is an impediment to intermittent chemotherapy. We investigated the effect of presumptive intermittent treatment with amodiaquine and daily iron supplementation in infants on malarial fevers and anaemia, in a holoendemic area of Tanzania where malaria is largely resistant to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine.           METHODS: 291 infants aged 12-16 weeks who attended three clinics were randomised to receive amodiaquine, iron supplementation, amodiaquine plus iron supplementation, or placebo. Over 6 months, we gave amodiaquine three times with intervals of 60 days; oral iron supplementation was given daily.

Protective efficacy was similar in the group receiving amodiaquine plus iron supplementation. Infants receiving iron supplementation only were partly protected against anaemia (protective efficacy 59.8%; 95% CI, 23.4-78.9), but not against malarial fevers. 4 months' follow-up did not show rebound morbidity.

All residing adults aged 15-44 years who participated in surveys in 1994-1995, 1996-1997 and 1999-2000 were tested for HIV infection and provided information on sexual behaviour. The district AIDS control programme was the only intervention. The prevalence of HIV among adults aged 15-44 years increased gradually from 5.9% in 1994-1995 to 6.6% in 1996-1997 and 8.1% in 1999-2000. The incidence of HIV increased from 0.8 to 1.3 per 100 person-years during 1994-1997 and 1997-2000, respectively. In spite of a modest increase in knowledge during the study period, most individuals continued to feel that they were not at risk of HIV, and sexual risk behaviour remained largely unchanged, except for a small increase in condom use. HIV transmission levels continued to be higher in the trading centre than in the nearby rural villages within this small geographical area, although differences became smaller over time. The gradual and continuing spread of HIV and the striking lack of change in sexual behaviour in this rural population suggest that the low-cost district intervention package does not appear to be adequate to stem the growth of the epidemic, and more intensive AIDS control efforts are needed."

Impact of HIV on child mortality is analyzed in a longitudinal community-based study in Kisesa ward, Mwanza region. HIV data on 4273 mothers from 3 rounds of serologic testing are linked to survival information for 6049 children born between 1994 and 2001, contributing 10,002 person-years of observation and 584 child deaths. Impacts of maternal survival and HIV status on child mortality are assessed using hazard analysis. Infant mortality for children of HIV-positive mothers was 158 per 1000 live births compared with 79 per 1000 for children of uninfected mothers; by age 5, child mortality risks were 270 per 1000 live births and 135 per 1000, respectively. Fifty-one deaths were observed among child-bearing women, 14 to HIV-positive mothers. Infant mortality among children whose mothers died was 489 per 1000 live births compared with 84 per 1000 for children of surviving mothers. Maternal death effects were statistically independent of HIV status. Allowing for age, sex, twinning, birth interval, maternal education, and residence, the child death hazard ratio for maternal HIV infection was 2.3 (1.7-3.3); hazard ratio associated with maternal death was 4.8 (2.7-8.4). The HIV-attributable fraction of infant mortality is 8.3% in a population in which prevalence among women giving birth is around 6.2%."

The new first-line treatment is either sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) monotherapy, or a combination of SP with either chloroquine or amodiaquine. Two national malaria control programmes, Burundi and Zanzibar, have decided upon amodiaquine-artesunate as their first-line treatment, although SP will continue to fill this role until the new policy can be implemented. Given the broad uniformity of parasite chemoresistance in the six countries, The East African Network for Monitoring Antimalarial Treatment (EANMAT) has focused attention on, and worked towards, a sub-regional antimalarial drug policy, where the evidence base would be the entire portfolio of network in vivo test results. Currently, there are several different antimalarial drug policies within the EANMAT area: the intention is to eventually replace this plethora of policies with a single, sub-regional policy based upon combination therapy. Currently, successful malaria treatment depends primarily upon the efficacy of SP, and of amodiaquine, which is either a component of first-line treatment, or the second line drug. This report addresses the results of WHO in vivo tests on these two monotherapies within the network. Results are analysed to assess the evidence for change in parasite susceptibility over time; the range of susceptibility to each drug within countries, and the implications of test results on policy."

Cost effectiveness (CE) ratios of the intervention were obtained for low birth weight (LBW) live births and stillbirths averted and cost per DALY saved. Cost per DALY saved was also estimated for previous CE studies of syphilis screening. The CE of the intervention at different syphilis prevalence rates was modelled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            RESULTS: The economic cost of the intervention is $1.44 per woman screened, $20 per woman treated, and $187 per adverse birth outcome averted. The cost per DALY saved is $110 with LBW as the only adverse outcome. When including stillbirth, this estimate improves 10-fold to $10.56 per DALY saved. The cost per DALY saved from all syphilis screening studies ranged from $3.97 to $18.73.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CONCLUSIONS: Syphilis screening is shown to be at least as cost effective as PMTCT and more cost effective than many widely implemented interventions. There is urgent need for scaling up syphilis screening and treatment in high prevalence areas. The CE of screening interventions is highly dependent on disease prevalence. In combination, PMTCT and syphilis screening and treatment interventions may achieve economies of scope and thus improved efficiency."

If antibodies against the sexual stages of the parasite are present, these can prevent the fertilization of the gametes or further development of the sporogonic stages in the mosquito, thereby preventing the transmission of the parasite to another human. Such transmission-blocking immunity (TBI) has been observed in sera from the inhabitants of malaria-endemic areas (Mendis et al., 1997) and has been correlated with responses to the principle sexual-stage antigens of Plasmodium falciparum - Pfs230 (Graves et al., 1988) and epitopes I and III of Pfs48/45 (Roeffen et al., 1995b). In maternal sera collected in Ifakara, Tanzania - an area of intense and perennial malarial transmission - the levels of antibodies against the asexual stages of P. falciparum were found to correlate positively with those in the corresponding cord sera (Kitua et al., 1996). Maternally-acquired antibodies protected the children in this setting against symptomatic malaria for the first 4 months of their lives, after which there was a significant decline in the titres of these antibodies and a tandem increase in malaria-related morbidity. It is not yet known whether antibodies to the sexual stages of the parasite are also transferred from mothers to their newborns and, if so, whether the levels of these antibodies follow a similar pattern of decline in infants. In the present, pilot study, therefore, the presence and development of TBI during the first 12 months of life were explored in infants living in Ifakara. (excerpt)"

Poverty and sociocultural changes may contribute to the observed high levels of marital instability and high levels of short and long term migration in Kisesa, especially among younger adults. Marriage and migration patterns are important underlying factors affecting the spread of HIV. The most cost-effective intervention strategy may be to focus on the trading centre in which mobility is higher, bars were more common, and HIV prevalence and incidence were considerably higher than in the nearby rural villages. If resources suffice, additional work can be undertaken in the rural villages, although it is not clear to what extent the rural epidemic would be self sustaining if the interventions in the trading centre were effective."

Consenting subjects were interviewed, examined, treated and a serum sample was tested for HIV. The HIV prevalence in women in the general population was compared with unadjusted and adjusted prevalences in ANC attenders. Parity-adjusted prevalences were obtained by applying correction factors to the observed prevalences in parous and nulliparous ANC attenders.

CONCLUSION: In this rural population, the HIV prevalence in ANC attenders underestimated the prevalence among women in the general population, but this difference was eliminated by applying parity-based correction factors. Information on parity should be routinely collected in ANC-based HIV sentinel surveillance."

There was no selection for mutations in dihydropteroate synthetase, the target enzyme of dapsone. Search for complete identity in the highly polymorphic genes coding for merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 in parasite samples collected before and after treatment indicated that the majority of recurrent parasitemias were new infections. These observations on selection in Tanzania and the lack of selection reported from a less endemic area suggest that the active metabolite of chlorproguanil, which has a short half-life in the blood, may persist in the liver, where it exerts selective pressure on growing preerythrocytic stages."

The results were compared with those in communities with the mass drug treatment alone and with control communities with neither treatment. The polystyrene-bead treatments greatly and sustainably reduced the vector populations. Comparison of the communities after drug treatment ceased showed that this form of vector control contributed markedly to the prevention of a resurgence of filarial infection. Where Cx. quinquefasciatus breeding in pits form a major component of the vector population, use of polystyrene-bead layers could assist considerably in the process of eliminating lymphatic filariasis by mass drug administration."

Seroincidence rates in discordant couples were 10 per 100 person-years (py) and 5 per 100 py for women and men, respectively (rate ratio [RR] = 2.0, CI: 0.28-22.1). In concordant-negative couples, seroincidence rates were 0.17 per 100 py in women and 0.45 per 100 py in men (RR = 0.38, CI: 0.12-1.04). Individuals living in discordant couples were at a greatly increased risk of infection compared with individuals in concordant-negative couples (RR = 57.9, CI: 12.0-244 for women; RR = 11.0, CI: 1.2-47.5 for men).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   CONCLUSION: Men were more likely than women to introduce HIV infection in concordant-negative partnerships. In discordant couples, incidence in HIV-negative women was twice as high as in men. HIV-negative individuals in discordant partnerships are at high risk of infection, and preventive interventions targeted at such individuals are urgently needed."

The overall goal of the study was to obtain information useful in the planning control of HIV/AIDS. Results of this study showed that the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS were often violated on the sole basis of their known or presumed HIV/AIDS status. Morever individuals who suffered discrimination and lacked respect for their human dignity were both more vulnerable to becoming infected and less able to cope with the burdens of HIV/AIDS. The aspects of knowledge, attitudes and practices of health workers towards HIV/AIDS patients and perceptions and HIV/AIDS patients towards health services and health care providers are discussed. The stigma and its associated discrimination effects on voluntary testing, disclosure of information on HIV/AIDS status to family members or friends is described. Strengthening the legal framework to protect the rights of people with HIV/AIDS is seen as of paramount importance. Communities need to be empowered to understand and use policy and the law to obtain the care and support they require. In addition it is considered vital to create supportive environments to reduce stigma through national and community-based communication initiatives to combat fear and misinformation; to improve community based self-help services for people living with HIV/AIDS; and to increase accessibility to affordable antiretroviral therapy."

Nineteen children developed symptoms suggestive of clinical malaria during this period. Daily blood parasite samples from 13 children who developed clinical malaria symptoms and 7 who remained asymptomatic were genotyped by PCR-amplification of the polymorphic regions of the merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (MSP1 and MSP2) and the glutamate rich protein (GLURP) genes. Infections were found to be highly complex in both groups of children. Every isolate examined from both groups had a mixture of parasite clones. Daily changes were observed in both parasite density and genotypic pattern. The mean number of genotypes per individual was estimated at 4.9 and 2.7 for asymptomatic and symptomatic groups of children, respectively.

It has been argued that vector control should not be attempted in areas of intense transmission. Mosquitoes were sampled with light traps, pyrethrum spray and window exit traps. They were tested by ELISA for sporozoites. Incidence of malaria infection was measured by clearing existing infections from children with chlorproguanil-dapsone and then taking weekly blood samples. Prevalence of malaria infection and fever, anaemia and splenomegaly were measured in children of different age groups. All these measurements were made in highland and lowland areas of Tanzania before and after provision of bednets treated with alphacypermethrin. Entomological inoculation rates (EIR) were about 17 times greater in a lowland than a highland area, but incidence of infection only differed by about 2.5 times. Malaria morbidity was significantly less prevalent in the highlands than the lowlands. Treated nets in the highlands and lowlands led to 69–75% reduction in EIR. Malaria morbidity showed significant decline in younger children at both altitudes after introduction of treated nets. In children aged 6–12 the decline was only significant in the highlands There was no evidence that the health benefits to young children due to the nets in the lowlands were ""paid for"" by poorer health later in life. Our data support the idea of universal provision of treated nets, not a focus on areas of natural hypo-endemicity."

METHODS: (1) Tabulation of earlier data to compare personal and community-wide effects against mosquito vectors; (2) two cross-sectional surveys for malaria parasitaemia, malarial fever, anaemia and splenomegaly in children in eight Tanzanian villages, in which there had been community-wide use of bednets which had been annually re-treated with alphacypermethrin for 3-4 years; (3) comparison between children of different age groups and with intact, torn or no nets in these villages and in 4-6 villages without nets.                                                                                                                              RESULTS: A 90-95% reduction in infective bites outside nets in netted villages and an additional 54-82% reduction of bites among individual net users. Highly significant reductions (by 55-75%) in malarial morbidity for children aged 6 months to 2 years were found in netted villages with, for some outcomes, better results among individuals who themselves had intact treated nets. For older children, benefits were less clear or absent, but there was no sign that the benefits early in life were 'paid for' by worse outcomes in the netted villages later in childhood.

It is important to ensure high enough coverage to realize the full potential of the treated net method. By showing an impact on the vector population in the community these results provide a strong argument for organized free provision of net treatment, rather than relying on marketing"

The seven collaborative centres that participated in the study (three in Nigeria and one each in Ghana, Cameroon, Tanzania and Uganda) were all in areas of rainforest or savannah-forest mosaic where onchocercal blindness is not common. A cross-sectional dermatological survey was undertaken at each site following a standard protocol. At each site, the aim was to examine at least 750 individuals aged 5 years and living in highly endemic communities and 220-250 individuals aged 5 years and living in a hypo-endemic (control) community. Overall, there were 5459 and 1451 subjects from hyper-and hypo-endemic communities, respectively. In the highly endemic communities, the prevalence of itching increased with age until 20 years and then plateaued, affecting 42% of the population aged 20 years. There was a strong correlation between the prevalence of itching and the level of endemicity (as measured by the prevalence of nodules; r=0.75; P<0.001). The results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, at the individual level, the presence of onchocercal reactive skin lesions (acute papular onchodermatitis, chronic papular onchodermatitis and/or lichenified onchodermatitis) was the most important risk factor for pruritus, with an odds ratio (OR) of 18.3 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 15.19-22.04, followed by the presence of palpable onchocercal nodules (OR=4.63; CI=4.05-5.29). In contrast, non-onchocercal skin disease contributed very little to pruritus in the study communities (OR=1.29; CI=1.1-1.51). Onchocercal skin lesions affected 28% of the population in the endemic villages. The commonest type was chronic papular onchodermatitis (13%), followed by depigmentation (10%) and acute papular onchodermatitis (7%). The highest correlation with endemicity was seen for the prevalence of any onchocercal skin lesion and/or pruritus combined (r=0.8; P<0.001). Cutaneous onchocerciasis was found to be a common problem in many endemic areas in Africa which do not have high levels of onchocercal blindness. These findings, together with recent observations that onchocercal skin disease can have major, adverse, psycho-social and socio-economic effects, justify the inclusion of regions with onchocercal skin disease in control programmes based on ivermectin distribution. On the basis of these findings, the World Health Organization launched a control programme for onchocerciasis, the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), that covers 17 endemic countries in Africa."

Circumstantial evidence indicates that bedbug resistance to pyrethroid insecticides may evolve more readily in villages with incomplete coverage rates of treated bednets, allowing bedbug infestations to become re-established. Bedbugs have not returned to a village where nearly all the beds have been provided with pyrethroid-treated bednets for 14 years."

This study uses data from a longitudinal community study in a rural area in north-west Tanzania, where interviews were conducted on health seeking behaviour and expenditure with relatives who lost an adult family member in recent months. HIV status and verbal autopsy were used to assess if service use differed by cause of death. During terminal illness, people with HIV/AIDS made extensive use of both traditional and modern health services, and more so than people who died from other causes. The main factor associated with this difference was the longer duration of illness. Expenses associated with HIV/AIDS terminal illness were higher than for other causes of death, largely because of the longer duration of illness. The direct medical costs were about 1.5 times higher than the funeral costs and the sum of the medical and funeral costs exceeded the estimated annual household income per capita in this population. In conclusion, the rapid increase in numbers of terminally ill adults as a result of HIV/AIDS is likely to lead to an increased burden on all layers of the health system and household resources, in part because of the relatively long duration of HIV/AIDS terminal illness. However, almost half of all HIV/AIDS deaths in this rural population were not admitted to hospitals during their terminal illness and only a small proportion died in hospitals. If more effective treatment becomes available, a further increase in health service use and direct medical costs to households and community is likely."

Mosquitos were collected once a month for one year using four collection methods: human-baiting indoors, human-baiting outdoors, human-baiting in the forest, and cow-baiting. We found that both species A and C tend to feed from cows rather than humans; we did not find any preference for indoor, outdoor or forest-biting in either species. Both species had a peak biting density in October/November, at the end of the rainy season, and species C showed a second, smaller peak at the end of the cool season. These findings are discussed in relation to previous reports of the behavior of An. minimus s.l., particularly in light of suggestions that An. minimus s.l. has changed its feeding behavior in response to DDT spraying."

Two community studies have recently suggested that the antifilarial drug diethylcarbamazine (DEC) may have a beneficial effect of reducing the size of hydrocoeles of filarial origin. To test this hypothesis, a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was carried out in 1998 and 1999 in an area of north-eastern Tanzania where microfilaria (mf) carrier rates and hydrocoele prevalence rates were known to be high. Ninety-eight adult male volunteers (aged > or = 15 years) with chronic hydrocoele received DEC 300 mg per day for 12 days (49 patients), or placebo (49 patients). Circumferential and ultrasonographic measurements of the scrotum, and a serum sample for measuring W. bancrofti antigen, were obtained at the onset and after 3, 6 and 12 months. Scrotal size and hydrocoele fluid volume indices were calculated. No statistically significant differences in volumetric measurements between the DEC and placebo groups were found at any of the follow-ups. Separate analyses dividing patients by antigen status, hydrocoele size or presence of thickening of the scrotal skins gave similar results. Geometric mean intensity of W. bancrofti antigen was significantly lower in the DEC group than in the placebo group (P = 0.008), indicating that lack of compliance was not a significant factor. Two months into the treatment trial, mass treatment with monthly low-dose DEC was given to the rest of the community. We conclude that DEC is not effective in reducing the size of hydrocoele of filarial origin. Interventions to replace or supplement hydrocoelectomy should be investigated."

Forty-eight samples, stratified for age and parasite densities, were examined from each village (n = 288). Genotyping was performed by a nested PCR method using primers specific for allele families of genes for the merozoite surface protein 1 (msp-1) and merozoite surface protein 2 (msp-2). A high degree of genetic diversity was found within each village but there were no differences found among the 6 villages. Poisson regressions showed significant effects of host age, village and interaction between host age and village on the complexity of infection. There was a positive, non-linear relationship between complexity of infection and transmission intensity with a maximal number of genotypes found per individual even at high transmission intensities. Furthermore there was a significantly lower complexity found in adults (> 15 years) as compared to children (< 15 years) in the lowland village. This difference was not found as transmission intensity decreased. By comparing data from the same geographical area, using the same methods, and taking into account confounding factors, the present study provides evidence for an effect of both age and transmission intensity on complexity of infection with P. falciparum."

The model was developed using data from one area of coastal Tanzania and validated with independent data from different areas of the country. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the model's predictive performance. The model allows reasonable discrimination between high and low prevalence schools, at least within those geographical areas in which they were originally developed, and performs reasonably well in other coastal areas, but performs poorly by comparison in the Great Lakes area of Tanzania. These results may be explained by reference to an ecological zone map based on RS-derived environmental data. This map suggests that areas where the model reliably predicts a high prevalence of schistosomiasis fall within the same ecological zone, which has common intermediate-host snail species responsible for transmission. By contrast, the model's performance is poor near Lake Victoria, which is in a different ecological zone with different snail species. The ecological map can potentially define a template for those areas where existing models can be applied, and highlight areas where further data and models are required. The developed model was then used to provide estimates of the number of schoolchildren at risk of high prevalence and associated programme costs."

METHODS A model was used that describes the different hurdles patients with an STI take before they can be considered cured by the health services. The values for the input parameters for the model were taken from different studies. Data from an intervention trial as well as from a population-based study on male urethritis were used to estimate the proportion of symptomatic patients with an STI who seek care from a health centre. An observational study in four health centres where improved STI treatment services had been introduced provided estimates of the proportions of patients with an STI correctly diagnosed and treated. Patients who returned to the health centres after 1 week were interviewed about compliance. An estimate of the ef®cacy of treatments prescribed for STIs in health centres before the introduction of improved STI services was obtained from a study on prescription patterns for genital discharge syndrome (GDS) and genital ulcer disease (GUD). RESULTS It was estimated that in the catchment area of health centres offering improved STI services, 51±72% of patients with STI symptoms sought care from those health centres. About 76±85% of cases were correctly diagnosed, and of these 69±80% received ef®cacious treatment. Compliance with full treatment was estimated at 84%. The estimated overall cure rate achieved by the health centres offering improved STI services ranged between 23 and 41%. The proportion of symptomatic STI patients who attended a health centre before improved STI services were introduced was estimated at 39%. The estimated ef®cacy of the treatments prescribed was 28%. The overall cure rate achieved by these health centres was less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS ONCLUSIONS When assessing the performance of STI case detection and management all steps have to be taken into account that are taken by patients with an STI before they can be considered cured by the health services.

The subjects were 37 adult male residents who were found to be positive for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) at the beginning of the study (26 of whom were also found microfilaraemic with W. bancrofti at this time). Blood samples were collected from each subject in July 1998, January 1999 and July 1999, during the seasons when transmission intensity was high, low and high, respectively. The mean intensities of microfilaraemia and the mean concentrations of CFA were each slightly higher during the low-transmission season than during the two high-transmission seasons but the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Similarly, the mean levels of filarial-specific IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4 or IgE did not differ to a statistically significant degree between the three examination times. Microfilaraemias and the levels of CFA and filarial-specific antibodies all therefore appeared to be remarkably stable and largely unaffected by the seasonal variation in transmission. That no variation in the mean IgG4/IgE ratio was observed over the study period may indicate that the level of resistance to W. bancrofti infection in the study subjects was also unaffected by the transmission season."

Primary and recrudescent P. falciparum parasites were analyzed by PCR using family specific primers for merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1), MSP-2, and glutamate-rich protein (GLURP). All samples contained multiple P. falciparum infections. For all children with recrudescent P. falciparum, common alleles were detected in both the primary and recrudescent samples. However, in no child were the exact same alleles detected in both samples, indicating that probably at least some of the recrudescing parasites originated from new infections.

The observed malaria epidemics in Tanzania were also greatly enhanced by a rapid increase in immigrants into and/or from malarious areas and by deforestation. Changes in mosquito host-preference, increased human socio-economic activities, and the wide self medication practices and drug resistance are also likely to have played important roles in malaria epidemics in Tanzania.

This fall and rise in mosquito infectivity is attributed to the widespread use of antimalarial drugs, which initially tended to reduce the infectivity of patients for mosquitoes, and the subsequent development of resistance to these drugs in the malarial parasites. The rise observed in the sporozoite rates in Muheza in the 1980s-1990s may be attributed to widespread resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine, until recently the drug of choice for the treatment of malaria in Tanzania. Changes in the survival rates, abundance, or predominant species of the mosquito vectors are unlikely to have influenced the pattern observed. The role of antimalarial drugs in malaria transmission risk is discussed."

Reliable and timely health information is vital for operational and strategic decision making that save lives and enhances health. In Ethiopia information quality and use remain weak, particularly at district health offices and primary health care facilities to facilitate decision making. Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess the utilization of health information systems at District level in Jimma Zone, southwest Ethiopia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in all health institutions by interviewing heads/ units/departments of District Health Office, Health Center and Health Post from January to February, 2009. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using structured questionnaires, check lists, observation and interview guide by trained data collectors. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 16 and descriptive and logistic regression analysis was carried out.                                                                                                                                                             Results: The finding of the study revealed that utilization of health information was 119(32.9%) in all the study units/departments. The major source of data was routine and vertical program report from public institutions. The utilization of information was affected by many factors but from variables studied only documentation of data, catchment population profile charts presentation and quarter plan performance monitoring was found significant at 95 % level of significance.

Activities are poorly coordinated at the districts and primary health units where data was generated initially. Therefore, in-service training and updating of staff involved in health information system (HIS) at district, strengthening health information system inputs, timely and concrete feedbacks with establishment of functional health management information system (HMIS)."

Here, we show how deterministic mathematical models, in conjunction with analyses of standardized field data from communities with varying parasite transmission intensities, can provide a particularly powerful framework for investigating this topic. These models were based on adult worm population dynamics, worm initiated chronic disease and two major forms of acquired immunity (larval- versus adult-worm generated) explicitly linked to community transmission intensity as measured by the Annual Transmission Potential (ATP). They were then fitted to data from low, moderate and moderately high transmission communities from East Africa to determine the mechanistic relationships between transmission, infection and observed filarial morbidity. The results indicate a profound effect of transmission intensity on patent infection and chronic disease, and on the generation and impact of immunity on these variables. For infection, the analysis indicates that in areas of higher parasite transmission, community-specific microfilarial rates may increase proportionately with transmission intensity until moderated by the generation of herd immunity. This supports recent suggestions that acquired immunity in filariasis is transmission driven and may be significant only in areas of high transmission. In East Africa, this transmission threshold is likely to be higher than an ATP of at least 100. A new finding from the analysis of the disease data is that per capita worm pathogenicity could increase with transmission intensity such that the prevalences of both hydrocele and lymphoedema, even without immunopathological involvement, may increase disproportionately with transmission intensity. For lymphoedema, this rise may be further accelerated with the onset of immunopathology. An intriguing finding is that there may be at least two types of immunity operating in filariasis: one implicated in anti-infection immunity and generated by past experience of adult worms, the other involved in immune-mediated pathology and based on cumulative experience of infective larvae. If confirmed, these findings have important implications for the new global initiative to achieve control of this disease."

We did an open, alternate drug allocation study to assess the efficacy of chlorproguanil-dapsone in the treatment of falciparum malaria clinically resistant to pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine.                                                METHODS: Children younger than 5 years with non-severe falciparum malaria, attending Muheza district hospital in Tanzania, were treated with the standard regimen of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine. Patients whose clinical symptoms resolved but who remained parasitaemic 7 days after pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine were followed up for 1 month. Clinical malaria episodes were retreated with either single dose pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine or a 3-day regimen of chlorproguanil-dapsone. Those with parasitaemia after 7 days were treated with chlorproguanil-dapsone. Parasite DNA was collected on day 7 after first treatment with pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine and we looked for point mutations in the genes encoding dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dyhydropteroate synthetase (dhps).

Of the remaining 156 parasitaemic children, 140 (90%) were followed up to day 28, and 92 (66%) of 140 developed clinical malaria. These 92 patients were alternately retreated with either pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine (46) or chlorproguanil-dapsone (46). 28 (61%) of 46 children retreated with pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine were still parasitaemic at day 7, compared with three (7%) of 44 [corrected] children retreated with chlorproguanil-dapsone. Resistance to pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine increased from 45% (156/348) at the first treatment to 61% (28/46) after retreatment. 83 of 85 parasite isolates collected after the first pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine treatment, and before and after the second treatments with pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine and chlorproguanil-dapsone showed triple-mutant dhfr alleles, associated with a variety of dhps mutations."

As effective case management remains the mainstay of malaria control in almost every African country, antimalarial drug resistance is a major barrier to the implementation of effective malaria control policies. In order to function effectively, these units must have an efficient surveillance system which can provide reliable and current estimates of the severity of drug resistance. Without this information, it is impossible for the MoH to design and promote a rational antimalarial policy, but because of limited resources, especially of people and expertise, most NMCPs have been unable to initiate and manage such a system. The need for collaborative partnerships between the MoH and the research community prompted the establishment of the East Africa Network for Monitoring Antimalarial Treatment (EANMAT). EANMAT has attempted to bring together the complimentary skills of malaria researchers and MoH staff in four east African countries. After 3 years of operation, data generated by EANMAT have been used to review and modify national malaria treatment policies in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania. This new approach, which forges a closer working relationship between the research and policy communities, has effectively built capacity around the complex of surveillance, interpretation and use of evidence within a policy environment. The added-value of this approach is that the research community has learned to appreciate the constraints of policy development, and that the control community has established the need to build capacity and ownership of research evidence. Networks similar to EANMAT should be encouraged elsewhere in Africa to engender similar partnerships: to assist the development of rational treatment policies, and thus more effective malaria chemotherapy leading to significant lowering of malaria morbidity and mortality."

We conducted a trial in July 2000 to determine the efficacy of proguanil (PG) plus dapsone (DS), compared with that of SP, for the treatment of asymptomatic falciparum infection. A total of 220 children with parasitaemia > or = 2000 per microL completed the study; 112 had received a single dose of SP (dosage calculated for pyrimethamine 1.25 mg/kg and sulfadoxine 25 mg/kg) and 108 had taken PG 10 mg/kg with DS 2.5 mg/kg each day for 3 days. Clearance of asexual parasites at day 7 was 14.3% with SP, but 93.5% with PG-DS. The remarkably high failure rate with SP was not associated with occurrence of leucine substitution at position 164 of the dhfr gene. Both treatment regimens were well tolerated. Compared with available data on another antifolate combination, chlorproguanil-dapsone ('Lapdap'), PG-DS was slightly but significantly inferior in achieving parasite clearance (99.5% versus 93.5%). The estimated cost of a 3-day course of PG-DS treatment for a child weighing 18 kg is US $0.15. With the rising incidence of SP-resistant P. falciparum infection, PG-DS could provide an effective, affordable and already available therapeutic alternative for malaria in East Africa at least until chlorproguanil-dapsone is registered."

There is limited evidence that male circumcision practices in Africa may be changing. To assess the determinants of male circumcision status in a traditionally noncircumcising ethnic group and to investigate the reasons for increasing acceptance of circumcision. Data from a factory workers study and a rural cohort study in northwest Tanzania were used to analyze the levels and determinants of male circumcision status and assess the reliability of self-reported data. Qualitative data from focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were obtained to ascertain norms and values in relation to male circumcision. Male circumcision has become more popular in recent years, and 21% of 3,491 men reported themselves as circumcised. An increase in circumcision rates was observed in the rural cohort study during 1994 to 1997, though reporting inconsistencies are common. Circumcision rates were higher among men with higher levels of education and in Muslim men. Men are often circumcised in their late teens or twenties. The reasons for the increasing popularity of circumcision were investigated in group discussions and in-depth interviews. The most frequently mentioned reason was health-related; circumcision was thought to enhance penile hygiene, reduce sexually transmitted disease incidence, and improve sexually transmitted disease cure rates. Male circumcision is becoming more popular among a traditionally noncircumcising ethnic group in Tanzania, especially in urban areas and among boys who have attended secondary schools."

The study found that large numbers of out-of-school adolescents are sexually experienced, that the period from acquaintance or dating to sexual relations is typically short, and that sexual encounters are typically risky. The exchange of money and gifts for sex was reported by both female and male adolescents but perception and interpretation differed widely. Males perceived that females engage in sex largely for material gain while the females saw it as a display of a partner's love or commitment. These findings call for interventions to empower sexual negotiation skills among adolescents, promote condom use, and at the same time redress gender disparities in expectations and interpretations of sexual relationships."

DESIGN Population-based cross-sectional survey. METHODS All 15–19-year olds living in households selected by random cluster sampling were invited to participate. After interview, urine was tested for HIV and CT. RESULTS 9445 15–19-year olds were enrolled. HIV prevalence was 0.6% (95% CI: 0.4–0.8%) in males and 2.4% (95% CI: 2.0–2.8%) in females, and increased steeply with age (trend: P < 0.006 and P < 0.001, respectively). After adjustment for age, risk of HIV infection was significantly associated with female sex (OR=4.3), never having been to primary school in males (OR=2.7), and current symptoms of genital discharge (OR=2.3) or genital ulcer (OR=5.3) in females. The prevalence of CT was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.8–1.4%) in males and 2.4% (95% CI: 2.0–2.9%) in females. After adjustment for age, CT infection was associated with female sex (OR=2.4), reported current symptoms of STD (males OR=2.5, females OR=1.9) and positive leucocyte esterase (LE) test (males OR=3.1, females OR=2.6). Eighty-two percent of males and 79% of females with CT were asymptomatic. There was no association between CT and HIV infection in either sex. CONCLUSIONS There is a high prevalence of HIV and CT amongst adolescents, especially young women, in this rural population, highlighting the need for effective interventions to improve adolescent reproductive health. The high rates of asymptomatic infection imply that innovative strategies are needed to reach and treat young people with STD."

Trends in tuberculosis incidence were estimated from regional notification data. Of 10612 eligible tuberculosis patients, 44% had HIV infection, compared with 32% in the previous survey. The largest increase was observed in the youngest birth cohorts, suggesting active HIV transmission. Approximately 60% of the increase in notification rates of smear-positive tuberculosis between surveys was directly attributable to HIV infection. The HIV epidemic has had a strong influence on tuberculosis incidence. However, since 1995, tuberculosis notification data have increased less steeply, AIDS notifications have gone down, and HIV prevalence in blood donors has not increased a great deal. Another survey among tuberculosis patients in 5 years' time may show whether the HIV epidemic in Tanzania has reached a maximum or steady state."

However, the transition from efficacy to effectiveness cannot be taken for granted. We assessed coverage and the effect on child survival of a large-scale social marketing programme for insecticide-treated nets in two rural districts of southern Tanzania with high perennial malaria transmission. Socially marketed insecticide-treated nets were introduced step-wise over a 2-year period from May, 1997, in a population of 480000 people. Cross-sectional coverage surveys were done at baseline and after 1, 2, and 3 years. A demographic surveillance system (DSS) was set up in an area of 60000 people to record population, births, and deaths. Within the DSS area, the effect of insecticide-treated nets on child survival was assessed by a case-control approach. Cases were deaths in children aged between 1 month and 4 years. Four controls for each case were chosen from the DSS database. Use of insecticide-treated nets and potential confounding factors were assessed by questionnaire. Individual effectiveness estimates from the case-control study were combined with coverage to estimate community effectiveness. Insecticide-treated net coverage of infants in the DSS area rose from less than 10% at baseline to more than 50% 3 years later. Insecticide-treated nets were associated with a 27% increase in survival in children aged 1 month to 4 years (95% CI 3-45). Coverage in such children was higher in areas with longer access to the programme. The modest average coverage achieved by 1999 in the two districts (18% in children younger than 5 years) suggests that insecticide-treated nets prevented 1 in 20 child deaths at that time. Social marketing of insecticide-treated nets has great potential for effective malaria control in rural African settings."

A better understanding of the prevalence and risk factors of syphilis in African populations would help to formulate effective interventions for its prevention and treatment. The prevalence and incidence of syphilis were obtained from a cohort recruited in Mwanza, Tanzania. Two unmatched case-control studies nested within the cohort provide information on potential risk factors. The prevalence of active syphilis (TPHA positive and RPR positive any titre) was 7.5% in men and 9.1% in women, but in youths (aged 15-19 years) the prevalence was higher in women (6.6%) than in men (2.0%). The incidence of TPHA seroconversion was highest in women aged 15-19 at 3.4% per year, and around 2% per year at all ages among men. A higher prevalence of syphilis was found in those currently divorced or widowed (men: OR=1.61, women: OR=2.78), and those previously divorced or widowed (men: OR=1.51, women: OR=1.85). Among men, prevalence was associated with lack of circumcision (OR=1.89), traditional religion (OR=1.55), and reporting five or more partners during the past year (OR=1.81) while incidence was associated with no primary education (OR=2.17), farming (OR=3.85), and a self perceived high risk of STD (OR=3.56). In women, prevalence was associated with no primary education (OR=2.13), early sexual debut (OR=1.59), and a self perceived high risk of STD (OR=3.57), while incidence was associated with living away from the community (OR=2.72). The prevalence and incidence of syphilis remain high in this rural African population. More effort is needed to promote safer sexual behaviour, and to provide effective, accessible treatment. The high incidence of syphilis in young women calls for sexual health interventions targeted at adolescents."

Design: Open community cohort study with a demographic surveillance system and two sero-epidemiological surveys. Methods: Ten rounds of demographic surveillance were completed during 1994± 1998 in the study area, which has a population of about 20 000 people in a rural ward in north-west Tanzania. Households with deaths were visited for a detailed interview, including a verbal autopsy. Data on HIV status were collected in two surveys of all residents aged 15±44 years. Results: Mortality rates among HIV-infected adults were 15 times higher than those among HIV-negative adults and HIV/AIDS was associated with nearly half of deaths at ages 15±44 years. Verbal autopsies without HIV test results considerably underestimated the proportion of deaths associated with HIV/AIDS. The mortality probability between 15 and 60 years was 49% for men and 46% for women and life expectancy was 43 years for men and 44 years for women. By their second birthday nearly onequarter of the new-borns of HIV-infected mothers had died, which was 2.5 times higher than among children of HIV-negative mothers. Mobility of household members before and after death was high. In 44% of households in which the head died all members moved out of the household. Conclusions: In this rural population with HIV prevalence close to 7% among adults aged 15±44 years during the mid-1990s, HIV/AIDS is having substantial impact on adult mortality. A common response to death of a head of household in this community is household dissolution, which has implications for measurement of the demographic and socio-economic impact of AIDS."

Seven descriptive processes and outcome indicators of effectiveness were used: changes of malaria transmission and incidence over time; use of facility-based care services for malaria; patients’ access to professional advice; the trend of treatment failure over time of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and chloroquine; survival rates of severe cases at the district hospital; a district malaria control strategy; number of malaria specific training for care providers; and the number of activities carried out on mosquito control measures. The data were collected from 1996 to 2003 in the Muheza district northeastern Tanzania.

All six members of the district health management team were also interviewed. Additional data came from dispensary and hospital records, and published literature. The results show an unchanged malaria disease burden. The average number of clinical malaria episodes per child less than five years of age remained between 3 and 3.5 episodes per year in the district since the 1960s. The comparison of cases expected in the population less than five years old with those seen in the district health facilities shows a coverage rate of 33%. Furthermore, between 1990 and 2003, little training on malaria was provided to health staff. The findings imply a limited effectiveness of district health services on malaria control, suggesting a weak process of translating national malaria goals to activities at the district level."

The recent resurgence of malaria in this area corresponds with the rapid evolution of parasite strains resistant to chloroquine. The ineffectiveness of anti-malarial drugs may have left the people of the Usambaras at the same high risk of infection as they were before the introduction of modern medicine.

The total data set comprises 90635 subject exposures and includes individuals of all ages and both genders. Results are presented for hospital-based studies, laboratory studies, active surveillance of microfilaria-positive and microfilaria-negative individuals, and passive monitoring in both community-based studies and mass treatment programmes of individuals treated with albendazole (n=1538), ivermectin (9822), DEC (576), albendazole+ivermectin (7470), albendazole+DEC (69020), or placebo (1144). The most rigorous monitoring, which includes haematological and biochemical laboratory parameters pre- and post-treatment, provides no evidence that consistent changes are induced by any treatment; the majority of abnormalities appear to be sporadic, and the addition of albendazole to either ivermectin or DEC does not increase the frequency of abnormalities. Both DEC and ivermectin show, as expected, an adverse event profile compatible with the destruction of microfilariae. The addition of albendazole to either single-drug treatment regimen does not appear to increase the frequency or intensity of events seen with these microfilaricidal drugs when used alone. Direct observations indicated that the level of adverse events, both frequency and intensity, was correlated with the level of microfilaraemia. In non microfilaraemic individuals, who form 80–90% of the ‘at risk’ populations to be treated in most national public health programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF), the event profile with the compounds alone or in combination does not differ significantly from that of placebo. Data on the use of ivermectin+albendazole in areas either of double infection (onchocerciasis and LF), or of loiais (with or without concurrent LF) are still inadequate and further studies are needed. Additional data are also recommended for populations infected with Brugia malayi, since most data thus far derive from populations infected with Wuchereria bancrofti."

However, resistance to this drug is spreading fast and poses a major problem in changing the policy of the malaria-endemic areas of Africa, since there are not many other antimalarials with similar qualities to chloroquine on the market. Except for sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, most drugs are unaffordable. Aside from the budget, other problems includes drug safety, treatment regimen and dose, availability and distribution channels, acceptability, and adequate and correct information about the drug are among those to be considered. For simplicity, the dynamic process of decision making is divided into four major periods: grace, alert, action, and change. The details of the four major periods are discussed in this paper. This suggested approach will allow countries to make prompt evidence-based decisions about the difficult issues of changing their first-line antimalarial drug policy."

Infections such as malaria and HIV are debilitating their economies by killing the young and economically productive workforce. Research is essential for health development, yet less than 10% of the annual global expenditure on health research is allocated to addressing developing countries’ problems. Poor countries must face this challenge seriously. It is essential that they create strong national research infrastructures so that they can define priorities for health research priorities; influence national, regional, and global health agendas; and lobby for a more equitable allocation of resources. This paper discusses some of the barriers to establishing coordinated health research programmes in developing countries and describes how Tanzania has developed a new research model to try and overcome these."

The most common onchocercal skin lesion in the hyper-endemic community was chronic papular onchodermatitis (CPOD) manifested by itching, which was often very severe. There was a strong association between skin itching and endemicity (r = 0.75; P < 0.001). The prevalence of CPOD in the hyper-endemic community was significantly higher in males than females (P< 0.001). CPOD was only observed in subjects aged > or = 7 years. Many of the subjects were checked for microfilaridermia, by skin-snipping. The prevalence of microfilaridermia [58.2% (393/675) v. 6.2% (3/48)] and its geometric mean intensity (8.9 v. 1.0 microfilariae/mg skin snip) were both higher in the hyper-endemic community than the hypo-endemic.

Data on reported STD symptoms during 2 years of follow-up, and serological evidence of recent syphilis, were used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) for HIV seroconversion, adjusted for community, age, marital status, sex partners and travel. Population-attributable fractions (PAF) of HIV seroconversions associated with these STD exposures were calculated separately for the intervention and comparison arms, and for men and women. In men in the comparison arm, adjusted ORs for ulcers (14.8), discharge (3.3), any symptom (4.1) and any STD (4.0) were highly significant. There were no significant associations between HIV incidence and STD exposures in the intervention arm. The PAF were consistently higher in the comparison arm than the intervention arm. In men, the PAF for any STD was 39.6% [95% confidence interval (CI), 12.4-58.3)] in the comparison arm but only 12.0% (CI, 0.0-35.9) in the intervention arm. The PAF for women were lower than for men. These are minimal PAF estimates and they do not account for STD effects on HIV infectiousness. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of new HIV infections in men in the comparison arm were attributable to STD. Lower PAF in the intervention arm than in the comparison arm for men provide further evidence of the role of STD cofactors in HIV transmission, supporting the hypothesis that the Mwanza intervention reduced the duration of symptomatic STD, thus reducing the HIV risk associated with such STD"

HIV prevalence at intake was 10.5% and 15.3% among 1,594 men and 880 women, respectively. HIV incidence was just over 1/100 person-years (PY) in 1,427 men and 1.9/100 PY in 745 women.

HIV incidence among discordant couples was 5.0 and 8.3/100 PY for 41 men and 37 women, respectively. Mortality rates were 9.0 and 7.8/1,000 PY for men and women, respectively, and 65% of male and 60% of female deaths were attributable to HIV infection. In this factory population with good access to and use of STD treatment and with a moderate level of exposure to HIV prevention education, HIV incidence among men and women is still over 1/100 PY, which suggests a relatively high level of program effort is needed to lower incidence. More than half of all adult deaths were attributable to HIV, but greater increases in HIV-associated mortality are likely."

Lipopolysaccharide from these bacteria is the major activator of innate inflammatory responses induced directly by the parasite. Here, we propose a mechanism by which Wolbachia initiates acute inflammatory responses associated with death of parasites, leading to acute filarial lymphangitis and adverse reactions to antifilarial chemotherapy. We also speculate that repeated exposure to acute inflammatory responses and the chronic release of bacteria, results in damage to infected lymphatics and desensitization of the innate immune system. These events will result in an increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections, which cause acute dermatolymphangitis associated with lymphoedema and elephantiasis.

Parasite densities in both fever cases and in asymptomatic infants, were compared and a Bayesian non-parametric mixture decomposition algorithm was used to estimate the proportion of fevers attributable to malaria and hence the incidence of clinical malaria. Age group-specific densities of peripheral parasitaemia showed little seasonality, but the clinical malaria incidence showed a clear peak in the wet season in children aged less than 9 months. Estimates of the parasitaemia-specific incidence of clinical malaria were used to quantify apparent tolerance of parasites, and indicated that clinical episodes occurred on average at lower parasite densities during the wet season than in the dry season. These patterns could reflect differences in levels of anti-toxic immunity, but the nature of the seasonal differences supports the alternative explanation that the variation in apparent tolerance may be an effect of changes in the ratio of peripheral parasite densities to the sequestered mass."

METHODS: Participants were interviewed about sexual behaviour and symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases. First fraction urine samples and urethral swabs were collected and used to test for T vaginalis by wet preparation and culture, Neisseria gonorrhoeae by culture, Chlamydia trachomatis by ligase chain reaction and non-specific urethritis by Gram stain. Urine was also tested for the presence of leucocytes using a leucocyte esterase dipstick. Men were re-interviewed 2 weeks later to document new symptoms and signs of urethritis.            RESULTS: Complete laboratory results were available on 980 men. One in four men had laboratory evidence of urethritis. T vaginalis was found in 109 individuals (11%), gonorrhoea in eight (0.8%), and chlamydial infection in 15 (1.5%). Over 50% of men with urethritis were asymptomatic. The prevalence of signs and symptoms was similar among men with T vaginalis alone compared with men with other urethral infections. The sensitivity and specificity of the leucocyte esterase dipstick (LED) test for detecting T vaginalis were 80% and 48% respectively in symptomatic men and 60% and 68% in asymptomatic men. Factors associated with trichomoniasis included religion, type of employment, and marital status.                        CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of urethritis was found in men in this community based study. More than half of the urethral infections detected were asymptomatic. The most prevalent pathogen was T vaginalis. Studies are needed on the prevalence of trichomoniasis in men presenting to health services with complaints suggestive of urethritis since treatment for T vaginalis is not included in the syndromic management of urethritis in most countries. The performance of the LED test as a screening test for trichomoniasis was unsatisfactory in both symptomatic and asymptomatic men. Improved screening tests are urgently needed to identify urethral infections that are asymptomatic and which are not covered by current syndromic management algorithms."

Background: HIV prevalence comparisons for pregnant women and women in the general community show that prevalence in the latter is signi®cantly higher than in the former. An adjustment procedure is needed that is speci®c for the demographic and epidemiological circumstances of a particular population, making maximum use of data that can easily be collected in ante-natal clinics or are widely available from secondary sources. Methods: Birth interval length data are used to allow for subfertility among HIVpositive women. To allow for infertility, relative HIV prevalence ratios for fertile and infertile women obtained in community surveys in populations with similar levels of contraception use are applied to demographic survey data that describe the structure of the population not at risk of child-bearing. Results: For populations with low contraception use, the procedure yields estimates of general female HIV prevalence of 35±65% higher than the observed ante-natal prevalence, depending on population structure. Results were veri®ed using general population prevalence data collected in Kisesa (Tanzania) and Masaka (Uganda). For high contraception use populations, adjusted values range from 15% higher to 5% lower, but only limited veri®cation has been possible so far. Conclusions: The procedure is suitable for estimating general female HIV prevalence in low contraception use populations, but the high contraception variant needs further testing before it can be applied widely."

The development of a vaccine is a priority if improved and sustained malaria control is to be achieved. The best use of a vaccine in Africa will be achieved if it can be delivered through the expanded programme of immunization (EPI). We conducted a trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of SPf66 vaccine for malaria control when delivered through the EPI scheme in Tanzania.                                                                    METHODS: The study was a two-arm, double blind, individually randomized placebo controlled trial involving 1207 infants. The primary objective of the trial was to estimate the efficacy of three doses of SPf66 given at 1, 2 and 7 months of age in preventing clinical episodes of malaria. These were documented through a health facility-based passive case detection system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        RESULTS: Among 1207 randomized children, overall compliance for third dose was 91%. SPf66 was safe, immunogenic and did not interfere with the humoral immune responses to EPI vaccines. There were 294 children among SPf66 recipients and 288 among placebo recipients with at least one malaria episode, yielding a vaccine efficacy estimate of 2% (95% CI: -16, 16; P = 0.84).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     CONCLUSION: This has been the first trial of a malaria vaccine among very young infants. It provides information on the safety of peptide vaccines administered at this early age as well as their capacity to induce immune responses without negatively interacting with EPI vaccines. Given the modest protection previously documented in older age groups and the lack of efficacy in younger infants, this vaccine in its current alum-based formulation does not appear to have a role in malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa. The lack of efficacy found in this trial also raises concerns about potential difficulties of inducing protective immune responses against malaria through immunization in infants."

METHODS: Since 1994 a demographic surveillance system (with 5-monthly rounds) and open adult cohort study have been established in a rural ward in Tanzania. Two sero-surveys of all resident adults aged 15-44 and 15-46 years were conducted in 1994 1995 and 1996-1997 respectively. Qualitative data were collected on mobility, bars and commercial sex.                RESULTS: Attendance of the two rounds of survey was 5820 (78%) and 6413 (80%) in 1994/1995 and 1996/1997 respectively. HIV prevalence increased from 5.8% to 6.6%. HIV incidence was 0.73 and 0.84 per 100 person years among men and women respectively. HIV incidence under the age of 20 years was low among both sexes. Striking differences in HIV prevalence and incidence were observed within the small geographic area studied: HIV prevalence in the trading center was twice that in the area surrounding the trading center (within 2 km) and three to four times that in the rural villages (within 8 km of the trading center). Aggregate level data showed significant differences between the trading center and nearby rural villages in terms of sexual behavior, commercial sex workers, mobility of the population, and alcohol use.                                                                                                                                                         CONCLUSION: This study documents the existence of very substantial HIV prevalence and incidence differences within a small geographic rural area. The rapid decrease in HIV prevalence within a small rural area emphasizes the importance of concentrating HIV prevention efforts on high transmission areas, such as trading centers, especially in resource-poor settings. Furthermore, this has considerable implications for monitoring the spread of HIV through sentinel sites, as such sites are typically located in high transmission areas."

The species composition of the malaria vector population in several Tanzanian villages was overwhelmingly An. gambiae s.s. in a normal rainy season, but consisted of four species, all proved by ELISA and/or PCR to carry P. falciparum sporozoites, at the time of the heavy rains associated with El Niño. Thus any scheme, for malaria transmission control by replacement of vectors by genetically-manipulated non-vectors, would have to be able to replace more than one species."

The same samples served as controls in a parallel case-control study for which an additional blood sample was taken from each child during a fever episode. The relationship of the number of concurrent infections (multiplicity) with age and morbidity was analysed and results were compared to those of a similar study on older children between 2 and 7 years of age, carried out in the same village at the same time. The mean of 2 infecting genotypes per positive blood sample from community surveys was low compared to that in older children, and there was no significant age-dependency of multiplicity within the first year of life. Multiplicity of infection in fever cases was also independent of age. In infants, multiplicity was positively associated with parasite density and risk of clinical malaria, in contrast to the situation in older children (>2 years). The findings help in the understanding of infection dynamics, premunition, and development of semi-immunity in malaria."

In most schools (87%), the prevalence of reported blood in urine underestimates the prevalence of S. haematobium infection. Predictive value analysis suggests that a threshold of 30% reported blood in urine would identify most of the high prevalence schools (i.e. those with 50% or more children infected with S. haematobium). Although the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was greater in males than females, girls reported a lower prevalence of blood in urine than boys even at comparable levels of infection. Reported blood in urine in females was more specific (identifying 10% more uninfected girls than the sign in boys), but was far less sensitive (identifying less than 20% of infected girls than boys). The sensitivity of reported blood in urine was also related to age, being significantly lower in girls over 14 years of age. The proportion of infected children who reported blood in urine was also lower in schools where the prevalence of reported blood in urine is less than 30%. The results suggest that the selective treatment of children based on reported blood in urine in low prevalence schools would miss a high proportion of infected children, particularly girls.

Connective tissue marker levels did not correlate with the presence or intensity of infection. NC1 levels were significantly correlated with periportal liver fibrosis (P < 0.001), splenomegaly (P < 0.002), portal vein dilatation (P < 0.004) and the presence of portosystemic collaterals (P < 0.001); for PIIIP and laminin, none of the respective relationships was significant. Due to wide overlap of NC1 levels between individuals with normal sonography findings and those with advanced periportal fibrosis and portal hypertension, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of this markers to detect these individuals were low (< 40%), although specificity and overall accuracy in the given setting were good (80-90%). It is concluded that PIIIP and laminin are not useful as diagnostic serum markers of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis at the community level; NC1 was significantly related to various indices of hepatosplenic involvement, but its low sensitivity precludes its use as a screening tool under endemic conditions."

IgG3 titres except for H6-p190(1/6), were very low initially and remained very low throughout the first year of life. Clinical malaria incidence at the village dispensary was analysed prospectively in relation to antibody. No IgG1 or total IgG titre showed protective effects, but low IgG3 against p190(1/6) appeared to be a risk factor in some age groups. Given the large number of antibodies tested, this single indication of possible protection could merely be chance. There were no strong associations between antibody titres and entomologically assessed sporozoite exposure suggesting that transmission-reducing interventions may have little effect on antibody levels in such children."

This article reports a systematic approach in changing the antimalarial drug policy in Africa. The issue of changing the national drug policy in Africa came about because of the increased drug resistance. Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, has been the longest-lived first-line drug that satisfies the objectives set by the African national drug policy. However, resistance to this drug is spreading fast and poses a major problem in changing the policy of the malaria-endemic areas of Africa, since there are not many other antimalarials with similar qualities to chloroquine on the market. Except for sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, most drugs are unaffordable. Aside from the budget, other problems includes drug safety, treatment regimen and dose, availability and distribution channels, acceptability, and adequate and correct information about the drug are among those to be considered. For simplicity, the dynamic process of decision making is divided into four major periods: grace, alert, action, and change. The details of the four major periods are discussed in this paper. This suggested approach will allow countries to make prompt evidence-based decisions about the difficult issues of changing their first-line antimalarial drug policy"

The results show that, in spite of major socio-economic and environmental differences between communities, the relationship is consistent and non-linear. A generalized value of k (the exponent of the negative binomial distribution) for hookworms was estimated to be 0.34, which is consonant with previous estimates from cross-sectional data. Maximum likelihood analysis indicates that the severity of hookworm aggregation in humans has an inverse relationship to mean worm burden which is less marked than for Ascaris lumbricoides. A simple model, based on published estimates of hookworm burdens associated with hookworm anaemia, was used to predict prevalence of morbidity from prevalence of infection data for Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia. Predictions correspond to the observation that hookworm anaemia is highly focal, and largely coastal, in distribution. These analyses suggest that locality-targeting of chemotherapy is particularly appropriate for the control of hookworm morbidity."

Schistosoma haematobium, hookworm (primarily Necator americanus) and S. mansoni were the most common helminth species infecting schoolchildren in the district. The prevalences of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura were negligible (<1 %). Anaemia and stunting were highly prevalent and widespread. Hookworm and S. mansoni occurred more frequently in multiple infections with other helminths than as single-species infections, but triple-species infection was rare. Analysis of the frequency distribution of infection amongst schools showed that prevalences of S. haematobium and hookworm tended to be normally distributed, with medians 75% and 45%, respectively, while the distribution of S. mansoni was markedly skewed such that only 17% schools had a prevalence greater than 20%. An inverse association between S. mansoni and S. haematobium was observed. Geographical information system (GIS) analysis indicated that S. mansoni infection was highly prevalent only along the shore of Lake Victoria, whilst S. haematobium was homogeneously prevalent everywhere except the lakeshore. This pattern appears to reflect the distribution of schistosome species-specific snail intermediate hosts. The results imply that joint treatment for hookworm infection and schistosomiasis would be beneficial throughout the district."

We assessed the rationality of presumptive treatment in 688 Tanzanian children attended at the Amani government rural dispensary, northeast Tanzania, an area with low malaria transmission form April to December 1993. A total of 549 (80%)) children were clinically diagnosed by the attending clinical officer and managed as malaria cases. Among these, 216 (39%) children were misdiagnosed based on the diagnosis criteria 1(DC1) of reported or history of fever plus asexual Plasmodium falciparum density at any level. At cut-off point of reported or history of fever, axillary temperature of 37.5 degrees Centigrade or above plus asexual P. falciparum density of either >/=40 per microL (DC2) or >/=5000 per microL (DC3) of blood, 380 (67%) and 484 (88%) children were respectively erroneously diagnosed. The level of misdiagnosis increased with age and was significantly higher during the dry season. These findings suggests that in Amani an area with low malaria transmission, presumptive treatment based on reported or history fever was less effective resulting into a substantial proportion of children being inappropriately managed. However, in the absence of sensitive, simple and affordable diagnostic devices in rural health units, we consider that effective use of thermometers and consideration of alternative diagnosis among feverish children might minimise the magnitude of unwarranted malaria treatment."

The 2 net treatments were equally effective in reducing incidence of new malaria infections and the treated nets were much more effective than untreated nets. These measurements were made after clearing existing infections with chlorproguanil-dapsone. This drug combination was more than 99% effective in clearing infections 1 week after treatment and a study of children taken to an altitude with no malaria transmission showed that there were very few recrudescences.

A total of 2565 unfed female mosquitoes were collected, of which Cx quinquefasciatus accounted for 96.6% of the catch. A human-baited tent caught a larger number of host-seeking Cx quinquefasciatus than a calf-baited or goat-baited tent ( P0.05 ). The number of mosquitoes attracted to a human-baited tent was significantly larger than that attracted to carbon dioxide released at 300 ml min?1 . Only 25.3% of the human host attractancy was attributed to carbon dioxide. The number of Cx quinquefasciatus responding to a tent baited with a calf or goat was not significantly different from the number responding to a tent baited with carbon dioxide. It can be concluded that with equal availability of the three vertebrate hosts, Cx quinquefasciatus would respond more to volatile cues from a human host than from either a calf or goat, thereby supporting earlier data about its high degree of anthropophily. The major olfactory cue from a goat or a calf to which this mosquito responds is probably carbon dioxide."

Water treated with the synthetic oviposition pheromone received more egg rafts of Culex quinquefasciatus Say and Cx. cinereus Theobald than did the untreated water (P < 0.001). The residual activity of SOP did not decrease over a nine-day period, with the geometric mean number of egg rafts laid in the SOP-treated water varying daily between 2.5 and 8.9 as compared to 0.1–1.6 egg rafts laid in tap water. However, SOP did not attract ovipositing mosquitoes to nonbreeding sites, and both treatment and control received few eggs. SPW and GI attracted ovipositing Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. cinereus, and Cx. tigripes Grandpré and de Charmoy with the number of eggs rafts deposited in bowls containing SPW or GI being larger than that deposited in bowls with tap water (P < 0.05). More egg rafts of Cx. quinquefasciatus were deposited in SOP-treated water than in SPW (P < 0.05). When SOP was compared with SOP + SPW, more egg rafts of Cx. quinquefasciatus were deposited in bowls with the latter combination than in bowls containing SOP or SPW only (P < 0.05), indicating a synergistic effect between SOP and SPW. Similarly, when SOP-treated water and GI were compared with SOP + GI, more egg rafts of Cx. quinquefasciatus were laid in the latter bowl, indicating a synergistic effect between SOP and GI. The result suggest that the combined use of SOP and organically enriched water can be employed in monitoring of Cx. quinquefasciatus for control programs.

The district has multi-drug resistance. Another 100 under-fives, were treated with 25 mg chloroquine base/kg, given in three divided doses over three days (CQ). Both groups were comparable by age, pre-treatment parasite densities, and mean haemoglobin. All were admitted for 7days and followed on days 14, 21, 28. CTMZ cleared parasitaemia in 94% of patients by day 7 and CQ 14%. Mean parasite clearance times (MPCT) were 4.1 (CTMZ) and 5.6 (CQ) days. Resolution of symptoms by day 3 was 64% (CTMZ) and 41% (CQ). CTMZ had a high recrudescence rate of 18% by day 14. The MPCT for CTMZ is significantly higher than 2.6 days reported in 1975 (Muheza) and 2.7 days (Malawi) reported in 1991. The MPCT and recrudescence indicate increased tolerance of the parasites to CTMZ, the gateway to resistance. Limited and judicious use of CTMZ is essential to prolong its chemotherapeutic value. Chloroquine is an unsuitable first line antimalarial drug."

The method involved precipitation with 50 microL trichloracetic acid (1M) to 125 microL plasma or serum sample. 60 microL supernatant was added to 60 microL mobile phase, modified with 50microL 1 M sodium hydroxide/mL. The mobile phase consisted of 20% acetonitrile and 80% phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 6.15. Using 125 microL of the sample, limits of quantitation were 0.1 microg/mL for TMP, 1.0 microg/mL for SMX, and 1.0 microg/mL for AcSMX. The precision of the method was 2% to 11% over the range of concentrations tested, 0.5-30 microg/mL for TMP, 5-300 microg/mL for SMX, and 2.5-150 microg/mL for AcSMX, respectively. No interference with other commonly used drugs was observed. The method is rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive enough for pharmacokinetic studies. The small amount of blood required makes it suitable for pediatric patients. The method was used to analyze samples from Tanzanian children aged 6-59 months participating in a cotrimoxazole (TMP/SMX)/chloroquine randomized trial for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Venous blood samples from 68 children were collected 2 hours after the first dose of TMP/SMX (4 mg/kg TMP/20 mg/kg SMX at two divided doses for 5 days) and again at treatment day 4. Individual variations in plasma concentrations of TMP, SMX, and AcSMX were considerable.

The higher susceptibility of infants to clinical malaria in comparison with older children, in areas of very high transmission, may be largely a consequence of the short duration of infections which precludes the establishment of concomitant immunity. The high turnover of infections also implies that infection prevalence and multiplicity approach an equilibrium even in very young children, and calls into question the use of infant conversion rates as a measure of transmission intensity."

This possibly reflects the high level of natural exposure of the children to P. falciparum. The prevalences of IgG antibodies that recognize the three putative merozoite derived sequences contained in the malaria vaccine SPf66 (83.1, 55.1 and 35.1) is low but also show some age dependence. Three doses of the SPf66 vaccine induce a strong IgG antibody response against both the SPf66 construct, NANP and the three individual peptides. Vaccination with SPf66 did not result in an increase of anti19 kDa fragment antibodies. This reflects the specificity of the humoral immune response induced by the SPf66 construct. Among vaccinated children, antibody titres against SPf66 decreased over time following the third dose. However, 18 months after the third dose, SPf66 recipients still had significantly higher IgG titres and stimulation indices of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) than placebo recipients. Within the vaccine group, there is a trend for increasing anti-SPf66 IgG titre to be associated with decreasing risk of clinical malaria but this was not statistically significant. Results also show the difficulties of establishing whether antibody responses are related to protection in field trials in endemic areas."

Methods Two hundred and sixteen black Tanzanians were phenotyped for CYP2D6 with the use of sparteine, and for CYP2C19 with the use of mephenytoin and proguanil. Of these 196 subjects were also genotyped for CYP2D6 (including the CYP2D6*1, CYP2D6*3 and CYP2D6*4 alleles) and 195 were genotyped for CYP2C19 (including the CYP2C19*1, CYP2C19*2 and the CYP2C19*3 alleles). Furthermore 100 subjects were examined for the allele duplication in CYP2D6, leading to ultrarapid metabolism, with long PCR. Results The sparteine metabolic ratio (MR) was statistically significantly higher in the Tanzanian group of homozygous, extensive metabolizers compared to a historical control group of white Danish extensive metabolizers. Only one poor metabolizer for CYP2D6 (MR=124 and genotype CYP2D6*1/CYP2D6*4 ) was found. The gene frequencies were 0.96 for the CYP2D6*1 allele and 0.04 for the CYP2D6*4 allele.

The gene frequencies were 0.90 for the CYP2C19*1 allele and 0.10 for the CYP2C19*2 allele. No CYP2C19*3 alleles were found. The mephenytoin S/R ratios were not bimodally distributed. Conclusions Both the genotyping and phenotyping results show that there is a substantial difference between an African black population and a Caucasian population in the capacity to metabolize drugs via CYP2D6 and CYP2C19."

Another four villages received neither intervention until the end of the trial but were monitored as controls. Bioassays showed prolonged persistence of the insecticidal residues. Light traps and ELISA testing showed reduction of the malaria vector populations and the sporozoite rates, leading to a reduction of about 90% in the entomological inoculation rate as a result of each treatment. Collections of blood fed mosquitoes showed no diversion from biting humans to biting animals. Incidence of re-infection was measured by weekly monitoring of cohorts of 60 children per village, after clearing preexisting infection with chlorproguanil-dapsone. The vector control was associated with a reduction in probability of re-infection per child per week by 54-62%, with no significant difference between the two vector control methods. Cross-sectional surveys for fever, parasitaemia, haemoglobin and weight showed association of high parasitaemia with fever and anaemia and beneficial effects of each intervention in reducing anaemia. However, passive surveillance by resident health assistants showed no evidence for reduced prevalence of fever or parasitaemia. Net treatment consumed only about one sixth as much insecticide as house spraying and it was concluded that the former intervention would work out cheaper and nets were actively demanded by the villagers, whereas spraying was only passively assented to."

The aim was to compare highland villages, where the mean, annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR) for malaria is 34 and mean annual prevalences of parasitaemia range from 33%–76%, with culturally similar villages of the lowlands, where the mean EIR is 405 and prevalences of parasitaemia range from 80%–84%. The total survey population could be divided into six geographical subgroups, which can be arranged in order of increasing prevalence of parasitaemia. The prevalences of dense parasitaemia, of febrile malaria, and of anaemia all increased in the same order across this series of groups, the trends being statistically significant. The results of previous studies have indicated a paradoxical effect whereby children in regions with a lower exposure to malarial infection suffer, in the long term, a higher incidence of severe attacks of malaria. In the present study there was no sign of any such paradoxical inverse relationship between the level of exposure and the prevalence of malarial illness or anaemia. However, child mortality rates are similar in the highlands and lowlands, as are the median ages of children admitted to hospital. Overall, the present findings indicate that, for the populations studied, an artificial reduction in EIR would be beneficial, even in the long term, with regard to the chronic effects of malaria. This does not necessarily conflict with previous studies reporting opposite conclusions with regard to the incidence of severe, acute effects."

The peptide, EBA(aa1076-96), also bound to desialylated glycophorin A and glycophorin B when tested by ELISA. The peptide blocked parasite multiplication in vitro. The glycophorin A binding sequence was further delineated to a 12-aa sequence, EBA(aa1085-96), by testing the binding of a range of truncated peptides to immobilized glycophorin A. Our data indicate that EBA(aa1085-96) is part of a ligand on the merozoite for binding to erythrocyte receptors. This binding suggests that the EBA(aa1085-96) peptide is involved in a second binding step, independent of sialic acid. Antibody recognition of this peptide sequence may protect against merozoite invasion, but only a small proportion of sera from adults from different areas of malaria transmission showed antibody reactivities to the EBA(aa1076-96) peptide, indicating that this sequence is only weakly immunogenic during P. falciparum infections in humans. However, Tanzanian children with acute clinical malaria showed high immunoglobulin G reactivity to the EBA(aa1076-96) peptide compared to children with asymptomatic P. falciparum infections.

The occurrence of mutations associated with the active site sequence in the Plasmodium falciparum genes coding for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS) is associated with in vitro resistance to pyrimethamine and sulphadoxine. This study investigates the occurrence of these mutations in infected blood samples taken from Tanzanian children before treatment with S/P and their relationship to parasite breakthrough by day 7. The results show that alleles of DHPS (436-alanine, 437-alanine and 540-lysine) were significantly reduced in prevalence on day 7 after S/P treatment. In this area, a DHPS with 436-serine, 437-glycine and 540-glutamate appears to play a major role in resistance to S/P in vivo. Evidence for the influence of mutations in the DHFR gene in this investigation is not clear, probably because of the high prevalence of 'resistance-related' mutations at day 0 in the local parasite population. For apparently the same reason, it was not possible to show a statistical association between S/P resistance and the presence of particular polymorphisms in the DHFR and DHPS genes before treatment."

Children and pregnant women are the most affected groups. Control methods of source reduction which were effective in Europe and America using DDT spraying, larviciding and drainage of swamps and stagnant waters were not effective in the tropics. The complexity of the disease, the parasite' life cycle and the tropical environment within which it thrives calls for a new approach to malaria control, multilateral collaboration and funding an d above all commitment from the south and south-south collaboration. The long-term challenge lies on the discovery of better methods for malaria control. However, Africa cannot wait. Better utilization of existing tools exploiting their synergistic effect will save millions of lives."

A total of 549 (80%)) children were clinically diagnosed by the attending clinical officer and managed as malaria cases. Among these, 216 (39%) children were misdiagnosed based on the diagnosis criteria 1(DC1) of reported or history of fever plus asexual Plasmodium falciparum density at any level. At cut-off point of reported or history of fever, axillary temperature of 37.5 degrees Centigrade or above plus asexual P. falciparum density of either >/=40 per microL (DC2) or >/=5000 per microL (DC3) of blood, 380 (67%) and 484 (88%) children were respectively erroneously diagnosed. The level of misdiagnosis increased with age and was significantly higher during the dry season. These findings suggests that in Amani an area with low malaria transmission, presumptive treatment based on reported or history fever was less effective resulting into a substantial proportion of children being inappropriately managed. However, in the absence of sensitive, simple and affordable diagnostic devices in rural health units, we consider that effective use of thermometers and consideration of alternative diagnosis among feverish children might minimise the magnitude of unwarranted malaria treatment."

This paper argues that decision analysis provides a valuable framework for formulating such policies and combating the emergence and re-emergence of malaria and other diseases. We outline five challenges that policy makers and practitioners face in the struggle against malaria, and demonstrate how decision analysis can help to address and overcome these challenges. A prototype decision analysis framework for malaria control in Tanzania is presented, highlighting the key components that a decision support tool should include. Developing and applying such a framework can promote stronger and more effective linkages between research and policy, ultimately helping to reduce the burden of malaria and other vector-borne diseases."

For instance, 34 percent of Sukuma men in urban areas, 22 percent in roadside villages, and 10 percent in rural villages are now circumcised. Circumcision rates are higher among men with higher levels of education and those who are Muslim. Men are circumcised in their late teens or twenties. The reasons for the increasing popularity of circumcision were investigated in group discussions and in-depth interviews. The most frequently mentioned reason was health: circumcision was thought to enhance penile hygiene, reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and improve STD cure rates. Enhancement of sexual pleasure was a secondary reason for male circumcision. The causes of these changes in traditional practices, including the role of Islam and interaction between circumcising and noncircumcising ethnic groups, and the implications for health programmes, are also discussed.

Entomologic inoculation rates (EIRs), estimated as a function of time period and place of residence, exceeded one sporozoite positive bite per adult per night in some village neighborhoods during the wet season. Incidence of clinical P. falciparum malaria, defined either as fever with parasitemia or as fever with hyperparasitemia, increased with the EIR over the whole range of exposures. Each 10-fold increase in the EIR corresponded to a 1.6- fold increase in incidence of fever plus parasitemia (95% confidence interval 5 1.4–2.0). Therefore reduction of human-vector contacts will probably reduce morbidity incidence even at very high exposures. Incidence showed little relationship to estimated cumulative numbers of inoculations since birth, but decreased steeply with estimated cumulative time infected with trophozoites. This suggests that clinical immunity depends mainly on the extent of exposure to blood-stage antigens, not on the diversity of inocula seen, and thus temporary reductions in human-vector contacts are unlikely to result in subsequent increases in morbidity"

METHODS: Newly diagnosed and relapse tuberculosis cases consecutively registered over a 6-month period were enrolled into an epidemiological study of TB/HIV. Treatment outcome was based on information in tuberculosis treatment registers. Patients surviving treatment were assessed 3 years later by personal interview. Cause of death was determined by verbal autopsy. RESULTS: Of 561 patients enrolled into the study, 505 patients alive at completion of treatment were eligible for assessment at 3 years. Except for mortality, HIV infection was not statistically associated with differing treatment outcomes. At time of follow-up, the overall mortality was 19% and was associated with HIV infection (hazard ratio [hr] 3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6–5.2) and age 35 years and over (hr 1.5, 95% CI 1.02–2.1), but not with type of tuberculosis, gender, or initial drug resistance. By life table analysis, probability of survival at 4 years was 35% for HIV-positive patients compared to 90% for HIV-negative patients. Although no relapse cases were diagnosed, verbal autopsy suggested equivalent low rates of relapse in both groups. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the current approach to the treatment of tuberculosis patients regardless of HIV status. However, HIVrelated mortality remains high both during and following completion of treatment, and further studies are needed to determine if this mortality might be reduced by simple interventions which are feasible in developing countries"

Due to its molecular structure benflumetol occurs in the dextrorotatory and the laevorotatory form. Normal synthesis yields the racemate of both enantiomers. Enantiomers of some antimalarial drugs possess different specific activity. It was therefore of interest to compare the response of P. falciparum to the enantiomers and the racemate of benflumetol in a variety of fresh, natural isolates. Measuring the concentration-specific inhibition of schizont maturation, the parallel investigation of 29 isolates produced no evidence of substantial activity differences between (+)-benflumetol, (-)-benflumetol and racemic benflumetol, the mean EC-50 values being 8.87, 9.71 and 12.44 nmol/l blood-medium-mixture, respectively."

Information was collected using indepth interviews with 31 kiosks and retail shop owners and semi-structured interviews with 204 randomly selected members of households. It was found that 95 % of chloroquine stocked is from private uncontrolled markets mainly from Kenya, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia and some local industries. The kiosks and retail shops owners stock different brand names of chloroquine, with prices ranging from Tanzanian shillings 10 to 50 (US$ 0.02 to 0.1 respectively) per tablet. The trade names of the chlorquine stocked include Homaquine, Malaraquine, Dawaquine, Maxaquine, Shelyquine, Nivaquine and Resochin. Homaquine comprised more than a quarter fot he chloroquine brands stocked. Although most kiosks and retail shops stocked more than one chloroquine brand, details written on the containers of these brands do not show any difference in the 4-aminoquinoline contents. Ninety percent of the kiosks owners and shop keepers interviewed rely on the instruction provided by manufacturers in selling and dispensing various chloroquine brands. Only 10 % of the kiosks owners and shop keepers and 17 % of the clients knew the right dosages of chloroquine for children. These findings suggest that stringent measures should be instituted to ensure satisfactory selling of anti-malarials through open market. This could be attained through quality assurance and pricing of various brands of chloroquine. Also there is a need for educating kiosks as well as shop owners and community as a whole on the right storage, dosages and the effects of chloroquine."

A general questionnaire about common health problems, including questions about blood in urine and schistosomiasis, was administered by teachers to 25443 children in 137 primary schools in Muheza District, Tanzania. The prevalence of reported schistosomiasis was calculated for each school and used to select 15 schools across a range in prevalence. All children in the 15 schools (n = 2370) were interviewed again by a nurse and gave a urine sample which was subjected to a quantitative microscopical examination for the eggs of S. haematobium by filtration. The prevalence of reported schistosomiasis by the interview in the 15 schools correlated strongly with the prevalence reported during the questionnaire survey. The prevalence of reported schistosomiasis in the interview was strongly correlated with the prevalence of infection determined by microscopy and consistently under-estimated the latter by around 20% across a range in prevalence from 22% to 93%. The sensitivity of diagnosis by an interview increased almost linearly with the prevalence of infection, so that when the prevalence was high, more infected children reported schistosomiasis. The percentage of children who were correct in their self-diagnosis was independent of the prevalence of infection and of the mean concentration of eggs in urine, and averaged 75%. These findings suggest that self-reported schistosomiasis is a useful method to estimate the prevalence of infection in schools and might be used to identify infected individuals."

The ward, about 20 km east of the regional capital Mwanza and along the main road to Kenya, has a population of approximately 20,000. Kisesa ward is comprised of 6 villages. A baseline census of all households was conducted in 1994, and by mid-1996, a total of six rounds had been completed. Findings are based upon the analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. Overall mortality rates for men and women aged 15-59 years were 10.8 and 10.0 per 1000 person-years, respectively, with a comparable age pattern between the sexes. There was, however, slightly higher mortality among men under age 45. Verbal autopsies were conducted for 141 of 160 deaths. Communicable and reproductive conditions accounted for 62.5% of all deaths. HIV/AIDS mortality was associated with 35% of all deaths, and was the leading cause for both sexes (30% of male and 39% of female deaths). Among 50 deaths classified as HIV-associated, there were 30 deaths with clinical AIDS but no tuberculosis (TB), 13 with AIDS and TB, and 7 deaths among HIV-positives with no clinical AIDS. These latter included deaths due to malaria, hepatitis, neoplasm, and 4 deaths with no other diagnosis than a positive HIV test. No cause of death could be determined for 15% of cases. Mortality in Kisesa, with an HIV prevalence of about 6% in 1994-95, has increased by about one-third due to HIV/AIDS, and will likely increase further."

This study aimed at investigating whether the elevated serum IgE levels reflect a shift in the balance between CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells in individuals naturally exposed to the P. falciparum parasite. To investigate the role of Th1 and Th2 cells in the human P. falciparum system we used the ELISPOT assay to determine the ratio of IFN-gamma- and IL-4-producing cells after specific antigen or mitogen activation in vitro. The donors were individuals who had acquired immunity through natural exposure to the parasite. In response to the specific malaria antigens, very few IL-4-producing cells were seen. However, in the response of individual donors to the polyclonal T cell activator, leucoagglutinin (La), the anti-malarial IgE levels in plasma were correlated with an increased ratio of IL-4/IFN-gamma producing cells. Thus, donors with ratios of IL-4/IFN-gamma > 1 exhibited mean plasma anti-malarial IgE levels significantly greater than those with ratios < 1. In individuals not living in P. falciparum-endemic areas the ratio of IL-4/IFN-gamma was always < 1. Taken together, our data suggest a shift in the balance between Th1 and Th2 cells in naturally P. falciparum-primed individuals, associated with elevated anti-P. falciparum plasma IgE levels. The role and biological significance of IgE (Th2-type immune response) for protection against P. falciparum and/or pathogenesis of malaria require further study."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether MBL plays a role in the HIV and tuberculosis epidemics in Africa. Thus, the authors determined the MBL serum concentration in 173 HIV infected patients (150 with concomitant tuberculosis), 94 patients with tuberculosis without being HIV infected, and 113 controls from Tanzania. The frequency of MBL deficiency was significantly increased in HIV infected patients compared with controls (12.1% and 3.5%, respectively). The frequency of patients deficient of MBL did not differ between controls and HIV negative patients with tuberculosis. However, HIV negative patients with tuberculosis had significantly higher MBL levels than both controls and HIV infected patients with or without tuberculosis. These results indicate that low levels of MBL are associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted HIV infection in Africans. By contrast, high levels of MBL may be involved in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis in immunocompetent individuals."

The baseline prevalence of HIV was 4% in both groups. During the 2-year study period, 11,632 cases of STDs were treated in the intervention health units. The HIV seroconversion rate was 1.16% in the intervention communities and 1.86% in the comparison communities--a difference in HIV incidence of 0.70 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-1.09) and a reduction of about 40%. The total annual cost of the intervention was US$59,060 ($0.39 per person served). The cost of STD treatment was $10.15 per case. An estimated 252 HIV-1 infections were averted each year. The incremental annual cost of the program was $54,839, equivalent to $217.62 per HIV infection averted and $10.33 per disability-adjusted-life-year (DALY) saved. The estimated cost-effectiveness compares favorably with that of childhood immunization programs ($12-17 per DALY saved) and could be further enhanced through implementation of the intervention on a wider scale. The intervention subsequently has been expanded to encompass 65 health units in Mwanza Region, with no increase in investment costs."

Sound evaluation of most new technologies is lacking in most developing countries, which also lack the technical capacity to ensure the safety, quality and compliance with manufacturing practice standards of these technologies. This has allowed introduction of new health care technologies, often before proper evaluation and sometimes based on unjustified preferences or fashions Appropriate technology is defined as the adaptation to local circumstances and conditions of knowledge and skills which are scientifically sound and acceptable to those who apply them and those for whom they are used. It should be affordable and should include appropriate use and effective interaction between service users and performers, as well as control of the cost and clinical benefits. Appropriate technology does not mean primitive or necessarily simple and/or less expensive. The initial cost should be considered within the context of the overall benefits and the expected outcome in the long run. Priority should be given to technologies improving public health services, with emphasis on equal access to health care for all. Appropriate technology may differ over time as a result of the impact of already available and newly developed technologies on effective service delivery. Countries have different needs, policies, priorities and capabilities in health care. When deciding on appropriate technology, all these factors should be taken into account. Developing countries should avoid wasting precious resources by purchasing sub-standard, obsolete or improperly re-conditioned medical devices with reduced life expectancies. A number of the future technologies might be appropriate for developing countries. Biomedical and technological progress have provided modem and sophisticated, often expensive, health technologies but development of more affordable and cost-effective high technology is required. There is hope that such development will be stimulated by advances in molecular biology, computerization of analysis instruments and telecommunications. During the past 10 years there has been a transition in industry focusing on a variety of advanced technologies involving chemical and physical approaches as well as biological approaches and, increasingly, genetic approaches. Owing to the ever-increasing costs of hospitalization it is anticipated that medicine will move out of the hospital. It is also anticipated that health care structures will change more or less dramatically in different parts of the world. It is recommended that, before embarking on new technologies and looking into the suitability of a technology for a certain level of health service, the cost and costeffectiveness of these new technologies, compared with existing alternatives are identified. It is also recommended that Member States take necessary measures to formulate sound national policies on health care technology and establish comprehensive plans for policy implementation. Emphasis should be placed on technology selection, evaluation, adaptation, transfer and rational use."

Included were 253 voluntary blood donors (predominantly secondary school students), 952 relative blood donors, and 1025 patients with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from Mwanza, Tanzania. The overall prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)--a measure of current infection--was 9.9% in voluntary donors, 11.2% in relative donors, and 8.1% in STD patients, with a 2.2:1 carrier ratio of men to women. The prevalences of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), anti-hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and past or recent syphilis were significantly lower among voluntary donors than in the other 2 groups. Evidence of past infection with HBV (anti-HBc) was associated with recent syphilis in both men and women (odds ratios (ORs), 1.91 and 2.34, respectively) and with HIV in men (OR, 1.93). Current infection with HBV (HBsAg) was associated with recent syphilis in men (OR, 2.13). In STD patients, current HBV was associated with Trichomonas vaginalis in women (OR, 3.57) and recent syphilis in men (OR, 3.46). There was no significant association between HBV and gonorrhea. Based on the association between syphilis and HBV, the population attributable fraction for sexual acquisition of HBV is estimated at 7.2% in men and 3.0% in women. Overall, these findings suggest that the sexual acquisition of HBV occurs at low levels in Mwanza. Improved vaccination strategies, early detection and treatment of syphilis, and programs aimed at reducing HIV transmission should enhance the control of HBV."

The occurrence of active site mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum gene sequence coding for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is known to confer resistance to pyrimethamine. This study investigates the occurrence of these mutations in infected blood samples taken from Tanzanian children before treatment with S/P and their relationship to parasite breakthrough by day 7. The results confirm the occurrence of one or more DHFR mutations in all the samples, but no relationship was found with the presence of parasites in the blood at day 7. The results suggest that alterations in the coding region for dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS), the enzyme target for sulfadoxine, should be studied in order to predict resistance to the S/P combination. It has been proposed earlier that sulfadoxine could itself act on DHFR, because of a false dihydrofolate produced by drug metabolism through DHPS and dihydrofolate synthase. The results of this treatment study suggest that such a possibility is unlikely."

Villagers frequently complained of typical colitis symptoms (abdominal pain 80.1%, bloody stools 43.1%, diarrhoea 35.1%); haematemesis, on the other hand, was rare (and reports doubtful in most cases). 16.9% of the population had been given praziquantel previously. Overall S. mansoni prevalence was 86.3%, with a median egg output of 176 eggs per gram (e.p.g.) and maximum output of 17,984 e.p.g.

Hepatomegaly (determined by ultrasonography) was present in 35%, splenomegaly in 80%. Organomegaly was significantly related to egg output. Pretreated persons had lower rates of splenomegaly and left lobe hepatomegaly. Low-degree periportal fibrosis was common, while severe grades of fibrosis (MANAGIL score II and III) were present in about 6%. About 10% had other abnormalities on liver sonography (irregular parenchymal texture and/or shape); these person passed significantly more S. mansoni ova than others. Clear sonographic signs of portal hypertension were seen in 2.1%. Serum procollagen-IV-peptide and gamma-glutamyl-transferase levels were increased in persons with severe periportal fibrosis, irregular liver texture of portofugal collateral vessels. Thus, S. mansoni infection in the western part of Ukerewe Island is frequent and often severe, leading to a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Hepatosplenic involvement does occur, although symptomatic cases of portal hypertension were not identified beyond doubt. The overall level of schistosomal morbidity is thus considered intermediate. Serum procollagen-IV-peptide may be a promising marker of schistosomal liver disease. Our data suggest that S. mansoni infection may also be related to diffuse liver parenchyma alterations in this area."

Data are also needed on the medical costs during the prolonged phase of HIV infection preceding severe terminal illness and the effects it may have on the provision of outpatient care. The study population was derived from a cohort study of factory workers and their spouses in Tanzania. Morbidity and outpatient health services utilization are estimated for 1832 adults who on average had been enrolled for two years and utilized the study clinic. Among those who had been enrolled at least 2 years, 50 cases (HIV+ since enrollment) and 150 control (HIV- until last visit) were selected, matched by age, sex and income level to estimate expenditure on drugs by HIV status. There was an increase in morbidity during HIV infection: the incidence of clinical diagnoses was 30% higher among HIV-positive than among HIV-negative adults (p < 0.001). HIV-infected adults also made more frequent use of the outpatient services (23% higher utilization). Estimates of essential drug costs among the subsample showed a 15% increase for HIV infected adults compared to HIV-negative adults, caused by higher use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs. The overall increase in morbidity, outpatient care services utilization and essential drug use due to HIV infection was limited, as HIV prevalence in this adult population was 11%. For example, the net proportion of all illness episodes attributable to HIV infection was 3.2%. Possible biases are discussed and suggest that our findings are a minimum estimate of the effect of adult HIV infection on outpatient care costs.

The assay was evaluated using 211 sera from clinically suspected cases: 142 from parasitologically proven cases and 69 from patients who were negative on parasitological examination. The test was positive in 128 out of 142 parasitologically proven cases. The negative cases may have been in the early stages of the disease, or may represent patients with antibody levels sufficient to prevent detection of antigen. Of particular significance, however, was the finding that eight of the 69 patients with undiagnosed disease were antigen positive despite the negative parasitological findings. Since false-positive reactions were not observed with blood donor sera, or with sera from malaria, schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis patients, it is reasonable to conclude that the eight antigen-positive patients were actual cases of sleeping sickness. The remaining 61 cases who were negative for both parasitaemia and antigenaemia may conceivably represent the variety of diseases whose clinical manifestations resemble those of rhodesiense sleeping sickness. The antigen detection method would thus not only be complementary to parasitological diagnosis, but essential for correct diagnosis in certain stages of the disease."

The programme used haematuria as a community indicator of morbidity for surveillance and for identifying individuals for selective population chemotherapy. Analysis of the first 3 evaluation studies showed that the prevalence of microhaematuria was linearly related to the prevalence of infection, and that visually detectable haematuria was a marker of the intensity of infection and risk of morbidity in a community. These relationships remained consistent during repeated community-based chemotherapy, suggesting that measures of haematuria may be useful tools for surveillance."

Community-randomized controlled trial. Mwanza region, Tanzania. A random cohort of about 1000 adults aged 15-54 years from each of 12 communities, in six matched pairs. One member of each pair was assigned at random to receive the intervention, and the others served as a comparison community. This cohort was surveyed at baseline and at follow-up 2 years later. About 100 antenatal clinic attenders were also studied in each community on two occasions: the first shortly after the implementation of the intervention, and the second approximately 1 year later. Improved services were established for the management of STD, using the syndromic approach, in rural health units. A total of 12,534 individuals were enrolled in the cohort study, of whom 8844 (71%) were seen again 2 years later. The prevalence of serological syphilis (rapid plasma reagin titre > or = 1:8, Treponema pallidum haemagglutinin assay positive) was 6.2% in both intervention and comparison communities at baseline. At follow-up it was 5.0% in the intervention community and 7.0% in the comparison community [adjusted relative risk (RR), 0.71; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54-0.93; P < 0.02]. The prevalence of urethritis in males did not differ significantly between intervention and comparison groups at follow-up, but the prevalence of symptomatic urethritis was reduced by about 50% (adjusted RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.24-1.10; P = 0.08). There was no significant difference between the groups in the incidence of self-reported STD symptoms over the last year of the follow-up period, or in the prevalence of any STD in antenatal clinic attenders. The reduction in HIV incidence previously reported in this intervention study can be attributed to a reduction in the duration, and hence the prevalence of symptomatic STD."

Setfing: The largest camps of Rwandan refugees in the Ngara District of Tanzania (estimated population 300 000). The study was carried out in 8 days in August 1994. Subjects and methods: A rapid assessment technique was used to measure STD prevalences among: (i) 100 antenatal clinic attenders (ANC); (ii) 239 men from outpatient clinics (OPD); and (iii) 289 men from the community. Interviews (by questionnaire) and genital examination were performed for all participants; sampling for females included genital swabs for the the diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Candida albicans (CA), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and a blood sample for syphilis serology. Men provided urine samples which were screened for leucocytes using the leucocyte esterase (LE) dipstick; urethral swabs for Gram stain were taken from men with a reactive LE test and from those with symptoms or signs of urethritis. OPD males provided a blood sample for syphilis serology. Results: All groups reported frequent experience with STDs and engaging in risky sexual behaviour prior to the survey. During the establishment of the camps, sexual activity was reportedly low. Over 50% of ANC attenders were infected with agents causing vaginitis (TV/BV/CA) and 3% were infected with NG. The prevalence of active syphilis was 4%. In the male outpatients, the prevalence of urethritis was 2-6% and of serological syphilis was 6. 1%. Among males in the community, the prevalence of urethritis was 2-9% (the majority being asymptomatic infections). We noted frequent over-reporting of STD symptoms, unconfirmed clinically or biologically. Conclusions: STD case detection and management should be improved by training health workers in using the WHO syndromic approach, and through IEC campaigns encouraging attendance at clinics. Rapid epidemiological methods provide quick and useful information at low cost in refugee camps."

Patterns of sexual behaviour have been implicated in the spread of the epidemic, but few quantitative data are available on sexual behaviour in rural populations in Africa. This paper reports data from a survey of 1117 adults aged 15-54 years selected randomly from twelve rural communities in Mwanza Region, Tanzania. Sexual debut occurred early, 50% of women and 46% of men reporting first sex before age 16. On average, women married 1.8 years and men 6.1 years after their sexual debut. In women, age at sexual debut appears to have increased over time, in parallel with an increase in age at first marriage. Men were generally married later, to women around five to ten years younger than themselves. Marital dissolution and remarriage were common in both sexes. Reported numbers of sexual partners were compared with those recorded in a population survey in Britain. More men reported 10 or more lifetime partners, or three or more partners in the past year, in rural Mwanza (48% and 29%) than in Britain (24% and 6%). Women reported fewer partners, and results were broadly similar to British data. Casual sex during the past year was reported by 53% of the men and 15% of the women, but only 2% of men reported sexual contact with bar girls or commercial sex workers. Only 20% of men and 3% of women had ever used a condom. Interventions are needed to reduce the high levels of sexual partner change and casual sex, and low levels of condom use, recorded in this rural population. Targeting of interventions to traditional ""core groups"" may be of limited value in rural areas, and additional strategies are needed, focusing particularly on teenagers who are at high risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases."

This elevation is highest in patients with cerebral malaria, suggesting a pathogenic role for this immunoglobulin isotype. In this study, we show that IgE elevation may also be seen in severe malaria without cerebral involvement and parallels an elevation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF). IgE-containing serum from malaria immune donors was added to tissue culture plates coated with rabbit anti-human IgE antibodies or with P. falciparum antigen. IgE-anti-IgE complexes as well as antigen-binding IgE antibodies induced TNF release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Nonmalaria control sera with no IgE elevation induced significantly less of this cytokine, and the TNF-inducing capacity of malaria sera was also strongly reduced by passing them over anti-IgE Sepharose columns. The cells giving rise to TNF were adherent PBMC. The release of this cytokine probably reflects cross-linking of their low-affinity receptors for IgE (CD23) by IgE-containing immune complexes known to give rise to monocyte activation via the NO transduction pathway. In line with this, adherent monocytic cells exposed to IgE complexes displayed increased expression of CD23. As the malaria sera contained IgG anti-IgE antibodies, such complexes probably also play a role in the induction of TNF in vivo. Overproduction of TNF is considered a major pathogenic mechanism responsible for fever and tissue lesions in P. falciparum malaria. This overproduction is generally assumed to reflect a direct stimulation of effector cells by certain parasite-derived toxins. Our results suggest that IgE elevation constitutes yet another important mechanism involved in excessive TNF induction in this disease."

Two spouse-related factors were significantly associated with HIV, even after adjustment for the sexual behaviour of the index case: HIV was more prevalent in men with younger spouses (P = 0.020 for trend) and in women married to men currently employed in manual work, office work or business (OR, 2.20). In women only, blood transfusions were associated with a higher HIV prevalence (OR, 2.40), but only a small population attributable fraction (4%). There was an increased HIV prevalence associated with increasing numbers of injections. Reported number of lifetime sexual partners was significantly associated with HIV infection (women: OR, 7.33 if > or = 10 lifetime partners compared with < or = 1; men: OR, 4.35 for > or = 50 compared with < or = 1). After adjustment for confounders, male circumcision was associated with a lower HIV prevalence (OR, 0.65; P = 0.11). In these rural communities, many HIV infections occur through sexual transmission. Some people are at high risk of HIV infection through large numbers of sex partners, whereas some are at risk through their spouse or regular partner. The role of circumcision in HIV transmission is unclear. Commercial sex seems to play a negligible role in HIV transmission in these communities. Our results confirm marked heterogeneity in HIV risk, indicating the scope for risk reduction strategies."

There are, however, few population-based studies that have controlled adequately for potential confounding factors.                                                    METHODS: Data from the five population-based studies in north-western Tanzania were used to investigate the association between male circumcision and the risk of HIV infection and STD. The effects of circumcision on HIV prevalence, syphilis (positive Treponema pallidum haemagglutination; TPHA) and self-reported STD were analysed, controlling for a range of demographic and sociocultural variables, and indicators of sexual behaviour.                                                                                                                                                                                            RESULTS: In north-western Tanzania, circumcision was previously restricted to Muslims and specific ethnic groups, but is now more widespread, particularly in urban ares and among more educated men. Assessment of the reliability and validity of self-reported circumcision status showed that these data could be considered fairly accurate, although there was some tendency for circumcision to be over-reported. On univariate analysis, circumcision status was unrelated to HIV prevalence in most studies. After controlling for confounding variables, however, there was a modest but significant reduction of the HIV prevalence among circumcised men [odds ratio (OR), 0.62; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.48-.81]. This effect appeared stronger in urban areas (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.32-0.68) and roadside villages (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42-1.01) than in rural areas and islands (OR, 1.00 and 1.01 respectively). There was no association between circumcision status and syphilis serology (TPHA), but there was a positive association between circumcision and self-reported STD, although this was not significant after adjustment for confounding variables.

Ethnic group and religious denomination are no longer the sole determinants of male circumcision."

For bioassays of insecticidal efficacy, female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were made to walk on the fabrics for 3 min and mortality was scored after 24 h. The main concentrations tested were: bendiocarb 400 mg/m2, cyfluthrin 30–50 mg/m2, deltamethrin 15–25 mg/m2, etofenprox 200 mg/m2, lambda-cyhalothrin 5–15 mg/m2 and permethrin 200–500 mg/m2. Field trials in Tanzania used experimental huts (fitted with verandah traps) entered by wild free-flying Anopheles gambiae, An. funestus and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Results of testing the impregnated fabrics in experimental huts showed better personal protection provided by bednets than by curtains. Permethrin cis:trans isomer ratios 25:75 and 40:60 were equally effective, and the permethrin rate of 200 mg/m2 performed as well as 500 mg/m2. Bioassay data emphasized the prolonged insecticidal efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin deposits, except on polyethylene netting. Most of the impregnated nets (including the ‘Olyset’ net with permethrin incorporated during manufacture of the polyethylene fibre) and an untreated intact net performed well in preventing both Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes from feeding on people using them overnight in the experimental huts. Anopheles showed high mortality rates in response to pyrethroid-treated nets, but only bendiocarb treated curtains killed many Culex. Holed nets treated with either cyfluthrin (5 EW formulation applied at the rate of 50 mg a.i./m2) or lambda-cyhalothrin (2.5 CS formulation at 10 mg a.i./m2) performed well after 15 months of domestic use. Treatment with deltamethrin SC or lambda-cyhalothrin CS at the very low rate of 3 mg/m2 gave good results, including after washing and re-treatment."

Diagnoses were made using well-defined criteria. Of the total, 127 (54%) were HIV-1-seropositive and 110 (46%) were seronegative. Tuberculosis was the most common diagnosis occurring in 95 (75%) HIV-1-seropositive and 87 (79%) seronegative patients. Bacterial pneumonia was the next most common diagnosis occurring in 18 (14%) HIV-1-seropositive and 17 (15%) seronegative patients.

Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was the sole source of a diagnosis in nine (8%) seropositive and six (5%) seronegative patients. We conclude that the HIV seroprevalence rate among patients hospitalized for acute respiratory disease at MMC is extremely high. Tuberculosis was the most common cause of pulmonary disease, regardless of HIV serostatus, and other HIV-associated opportunistic pulmonary infections were unusual. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage added little to the diagnosis and thus should not be high-priority procedures for the routine workup in resource-poor areas where tuberculosis is endemic"

Subjects with symptoms or with a positive result on testing were examined, and urethral swabs were taken for detection of N gonorrhoeae by gram stain and of C trachomatis by antigen detection immunoassay. SETTING: Mwanza region, north western Tanzania. SUBJECTS: 5876 men aged 15-54 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of urethral symptoms, observed urethral discharge, pyuria, urethritis ( > 4 pus cells per high power field on urethral smear), N gonorrhoeae infection (intracellular gram negative diplococci), and C trachomatis infection (IDEIA antigen detection assay). RESULTS: 1618 (28%) subjects reported ever having a urethral discharge. Current discharge was reported by 149 (2.5%) and observed on examination in 207 (3.5%). Gonorrhoea was found in 128 subjects (2.2%) and chlamydial infection in 39 (0.7%). Only 24 of 158 infected subjects complained of urethral discharge at the time of interview (15%). CONCLUSION: Infection with N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis is commonly asymptomatic among men in this rural African population. This has important implications for the design of control programmes for sexually transmitted disease."

Anopheles minimus Theobald and An. sinensis Wiedemann were common in all areas endemic for malaria. Knowledge of the biology and bionomics of the mosquitos in malaria endemic areas formed the basis for formulating strategies for the control of vectors and subsequent surveillance activities. Insecticide residual spray, larvivorous fishes and environmental management were the basic strategies for vector control.

The proportion of men reporting casual sex partners during the last month was almost halved: from 9.8 to 5.2%. The decline in the reporting of extramarital partners was gradual and pronounced. There were only minor changes in reported condom use, notably an increase in use with casual partners, and no changes in coital frequency. Data from in-depth interviews confirmed that reduction in sexual partners was the predominant change.

Ten subjects (4.6%, 2.2% to 8.3%, 95% CI) with an S/R mephenytoin ratio >0.9, were arbitrarily defined as poor metabolizers of mephenytoin.

This indicates that cytochrome P4502C19 or CYP2C19 is a major enzyme that catalyzes the bioactivation of chloroguanide to cycloguanil. Chloroguanide is a pro-drug, and hence a low CYP2C19 activity may lead to prophylactic failure caused by inadequate formation of cycloguanil. Fifty-eight women who previously took either 200 mg chloroguanide daily (n = 26) or 200 mg chloroguanide daily plus 300 mg chloroquine weekly (n = 32) in a malaria chemoprophylaxis study showed that there was significant correlation between the number of earlier breakthrough parasitemia episodes and the chloroguanide/cycloguanil ratio (rs = 0.30; p = 0.02). The breakthrough rate did not correlate with the S/R mephenytoin ratio. However, other factors, such as exposure to mosquitoes and sensitivity of the plasmodium to cycloguanil, are probably more important."

RESULTS: HIV-1 incidence was 1.2 (95% CI 0.7-2.0) per 100 person-years (pyr). Crude annual mortality was 4.9 per 100 pyr in those with and 0.3 in those without HIV-1 infection, giving an age and sex adjusted mortality ratio of 12.9 (95% CI 5.4-30.7). Of all deaths, 62% were attributable to HIV-1 infection.                                                                                                                             CONCLUSION: HIV-1 infection was a major public health problem, being the major cause of death in this adult population. At an HIV-1 incidence of 1.2 per 100 pyr, a large cohort size would be required to evaluate the impact of interventions on HIV-1 incidence."

Discussions with village members sparked interest, so TANESA launched a health promotion program. It first set up a pilot project in a village of about 600 persons with an established fishing camp. TANESA trained 6 young women and 8 fishermen during a 4-day workshop as peer educators. The topics included anatomy and biology, STDs, HIV prevention, adult education, counseling, and communication skills. Training techniques used were short lectures, group discussions, role-playing, and exercises from a workbook. The newly trained peer educators helped set up a general education campaign: video shows, exhibition boards, pamphlets, condom distribution, and discussion sessions with peers. Village leaders did not support the idea of official classes, an AIDS information room, or a village health committee. Nevertheless, the peer educators continued their mission. Once a month, the program coordinator visits them and advocates the program to village leaders. TANESA next replicated the program in a larger village (about 6000 population). This time, it first mobilized village leaders to develop the program themselves. The core groups were fishermen, female bar and guesthouse workers, and young unemployed women offering sex for money. Each group chose its own peer educators. Village leaders were responsible for the educational campaign organized by the peer educators. The campaign received a positive response and effected positive attitudes towards condom use. Village leaders organized an AIDS action committee. TANESA now provides technical support, fosters a team spirit among peer educators, and supports monitoring activities. Peer educators express an increase in their self-esteem and self-confidence."

Included in the survey were approximately 1000 randomly selected adults from each of the six intervention communities (defined as the population served by a health center and its satellite dispensaries) and six matched comparison communities. Overall HIV seroprevalence was 4.1% (3.7% in men and 4.4% in women), with a range of 1.6-8.6% and no significant differences between intervention and control communities. Peak prevalences for both sexes were found in the 25-34 year age groups and in roadside communities. The following factors were associated with an increased likelihood of HIV infection: separation, divorce, or widowhood; multiple injections in the preceding year; educational achievement of at least Standard 4; travel out of the district in the prior year; history of genital ulcers or discharge; and past or present infection with syphilis. HIV prevalence was significantly higher in circumcised men, but not when adjustment was made for other risk factors. Syphilis prevalence ranged from a low of 4.2% in island communities to a high of 11.1% in roadside communities. The baseline survey indicates that intervention and control populations are generally comparable, and that the goal of locating a study area with a relatively low incidence of HIV and high rates of other STDs has been achieved."

SETTING: Twelve communities in Mwanza Region, Tanzania: one matched pair of roadside communities, four pairs of rural communities, and one pair of island communities. One community from each pair was randomly allocated to receive the STD intervention following the baseline survey.                                                                                                                    METHODS: Approximately 1000 adults aged 15-54 years were randomly sampled from each community. Subjects were interviewed, and HIV and syphilis serology performed. Men with a positive leucocyte esterase dipstick test on urine, or reporting a current STD, were tested for urethral infections.                                                                                                                         RESULTS: A total of 12,534 adults were enrolled. Baseline HIV prevalences were 7.7% (roadside), 3.8% (rural) and 1.8% (islands). Associations were observed with marital status, injections, education, travel, history of STD and syphilis serology. Prevalence was higher in circumcised men, but not significantly after adjusting for confounders. Intervention and comparison communities were similar in the prevalence of HIV (3.8 versus 4.4%), active syphilis (8.7 versus 8.2%), and most recorded risk factors. Within-pair variability in HIV prevalence was close to the value assumed for sample size calculations.   CONCLUSIONS: The trial cohort was successfully established. Comparability of intervention and comparison communities at baseline was confirmed for most factors. Matching appears to have achieved a trial of adequate sample size. The apparent lack of a protective effect of male circumcision contrasts with other studies in Africa."

The greatest difficulties encountered in accurately determining the age of members of this species are due to small size and the low parity diagnostic index of the ovary, which decreased in successive gonotrophic cycles and could drop to zero even in the first cycles. Additional information can be obtained from basal bodies, groups of six to eight cells in the calyx wall enclosed by the end of the ovariolar sheath. The possibility exists of their use for age grading of mosquitoes. The mean age of the population during the study, which was carried out in the rainy season, was rather low. The oldest were individuals that had completed four ovipositions. Among the mosquitoes infected with sporozoites were females that had completed between ?2 and ?4 ovipositions."

The physiological age of the females could be determined only by gonotrophic dilatations formed from degenerating follicles during gonotrophic cycles. In individual females, the proportions of ovarioles with degenerating follicles were 3-54% (mean 22%) in the first cycle and 8-61% (mean 36%) in the second gonotrophic cycle. Agonotrophic degenerating follicles occurred in 2% of ovarioles in 12% of females.

In 278 samples tested for Campylobacter and 136 tested for ETEC from asymptomatic children the corresponding numbers were 12 and 5%, respectively. In children < 18 months with diarrhoea Campylobacter was noted in 22% and ETEC in 18%, whereas the figures were 11 and 4% respectively in asymptomatic children. In the age group 18 months to 5 years Campylobacter was demonstrated in 2% of the children with diarrhoea and 27% had ETEC, while the figures were 15 and 8% for asymptomatic children. Among adults the prevalence of Campylobacter-positive samples was 1% both for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. There were no seasonal differences in the prevalences of both Campylobacter and ETEC either in the symptomatic or the asymptomatic group. Campylobacter jejuni was the dominating Campylobacter species among both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. C. jejuni strains from patients with diarrhoea were significantly more often enterotoxigenic than were C. coli strains. The serotype pattern regarding Campylobacter was in general similar for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. We conclude that Campylobacter and ETEC are common causes of bacterial diarrhoea in Tanzanian children, and that Campylobacter infections are more important in children younger than 18 months, than in older ones."

In all the communities, the mf geomtric mean intensities in microfilaraemic males with and without hydrocele were not significantly different. The present study therefore did not indicate any association between hydrocele in males (the most common type of chronic clinical manifestation seen) and presence or absence of microfilaraemia. In contrast, only two (4.4%) of the 45 subjects with leg elephantiasis were microfilaraemic. In children aged 1-15 years, mf prevalence was significantly higher among those with microfilaraemic mothers (18.0%) than among those with amicrofilaraemic mothers (7.9%).

The study revealed an extraordinary static situation, both at the community level and at the individual level. No significant differences were observed in any of the three villages, with respect to total or age-specific prevalences of microfilaraemia, hydrocele in males aged > or = 20 years or leg elephantiasis in all subjects aged > or = 20 years, when the results from 1975 were compared with those from 1991. Overall, 542 of the subjects (37.2% of the total) examined in 1975 were re-identified and re-examined in 1991. Of those microfilaraeic in 1975, 81.9% were also microfilaraemic in 1991. Similarly, 81.3% of those amicrofilaraemic in 1975 were also amicrofilaraemic in 1991. Thus, most subjects had the same microfilarial (mf) status at both surveys. The low mf loss rate indicates that re-infection of microfilaraemic individuals commonly takes place, and results in repeated sequences of microfilaraemia in the same individuals. The rate of gain of microfilaraemia was independent of age, thus indicating no age-related change in the examined population's susceptibility to develop or sustain microfilaraemia. Individual differences in susceptibility to develop mirofilaraemia therefore appear to be innately determined, or to be acquired in pre-natal or early post-natal life. Neither the presence of hydrocele in 1991, nor the development of new cases of hydrocele over the 16-year period were related to the mf status in 1975 or 1991, and no association between microfilaraemia and this chronic clinical manifestation was observed. The association between leg elephantiasis and mf status could not be analysed because of the small sample size."

Blood-fed mosquitoes from pit traps outdoors, exit traps on windows and indoor-resting catches were identified cytogenetically and the chromosomal inversion frequencies compared between samples and species. Their outdoor-resting behaviour was assessed by a mark-release-recapture experiment and by determining the proportion of freshly blood-fed individuals in exit traps. The source of bloodmeals was analysed by an ELISA method. Endophagic females of An. arabiensis were more likely than those of An.gambiae to exit from a house on the night of blood-feeding. Only in one out of three villages was there evidence that chromosomally distinct individuals within a species had different preferences for resting sites. There were indications, but not conclusive evidence, that mosquitoes caught indoors or outdoors had a tendency to return to the same type of resting site. In villages sprayed with either insecticide, the mean age of the vector populations was greatly reduced, compared with those in the unsprayed villages. An.arabiensis females exited from DDT sprayed houses after blood-feeding, whereas with lambda-cyhalothrin those exiting were mostly unfed and there was a decline in the human blood index. The excitorepellency of DDT was perceived as a disadvantage, whereas lambda-cyhalothrin apparently had more impact on malaria transmission by An.arabiensis."

The effect of treatment was followed both among those treated and at the community level. In treated individuals, there was a rapid decrease in the mf load that was significantly greater among those receiving the 12-day standard dose. One year after the start of treatment, the mf clearance rates were 59% and 39% and the GMIs were reduced by 99% and 97% among treated individuals in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

METHODS--The minimum inhibitory concentrations of nine common antimicrobial agents were measured by the agar dilution method against 130 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated in a free government STD clinic in Mwanza town. The auxotype, plasmid content and serogroup of these strains were also determined by conventional techniques. RESULTS--65 strains (50%) were penicillinase producers (PPNG), and 34 (26%) exhibited chromosomally mediated resistance to penicillin. Seven (5%) were sensitive to tetracycline; 78 (60%) showed intermediate levels of resistance, and 45 (35%) had high level plasmid mediated resistance (TRNG), all of which carried a 25.2 MDa plasmid. 79 strains (61%) showed decreased sensitivity to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, and five (4%) were resistant to this agent. All isolates were fully sensitive to spectinomycin, azithromycin, cefotaxime, cefuroxime, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. One hundred and one strains (78%) were of type W11/111, 22 type W1, and seven cross reacting strains. The W1 strains were significantly more likely to be carrying plasmid mediated resistance to both penicillin and tetracycline. Six different auxotypes were present, the major type requiring proline. Plasmid profiles showed the presence of both the 3.2 MDa and the 4.4 MDa beta-lactamase encoding plasmids. CONCLUSION--a high proportion of gonococcal isolates remain resistant to penicillin in this region, and most isolates are now also resistant to tetracycline, with the emergence of plasmic mediated tetracycline resistance. Trimethoprim-sulphonamide sensitivity is also decreasing. The population of strains is heterogeneous, and both African and Asian beta-lactamase encoding plasmids are present."

HIV-1 prevalence was 91/926 (10%) in males and 36/217 (17%) in females. Statistically significant risk factors for HIV-1 infection in males were age group, region of birth, not being married for more than 5 years, being uncircumcised, having had a genital ulcer in the past four months, and having received injections from medical staff in the past four months. HIV-1 incidence in this group is expected to be between 1% and 2% per year. It is concluded that a longitudinal study is needed to assess the importance of partner change. This cohort appears to be suitable for such a study as HIV-1 incidence is expected to be fairly high, HIV-1 prevalence and risk factors are comparable to those of the general population and cooperation of the factory workers is good."

Having had sexual intercourse in the past month with more than one partner was reported by 22% of the men and 5% of the women. Factors associated with multiple partners in men were being born in or near Mwanza Region, having low education and low income, and being married. Condoms had been used in the past month by 3% only, mainly with casual partners.

For bioassays of insecticidal efficacy, female Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were made to walk on the fabrics for 3 min and mortality was scored after 24 h. The main concentrations tested were: bendiocarb 400 mg/m2, cyfluthrin 30-50 mg/m2, deltamethrin 15-25 mg/m2, etofenprox 200 mg/m2, lambda-cyhalothrin 5-15 mg/m2 and permethrin 200-500 mg/m2. Field trials in Tanzania used experimental huts (fitted with verandah traps) entered by wild free-flying Anopheles gambiae, An.funestus and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Results of testing the impregnated fabrics in experimental huts showed better personal protection provided by bednets than by curtains. Permethrin cis:trans isomer ratios 25:75 and 40:60 were equally effective, and the permethrin rate of 200 mg/m2 performed as well as 500 mg/m2. Bioassay data emphasized the prolonged insecticidal efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin deposits, except on polyethylene netting. Most of the impregnated nets (including the 'Olyset' net with permethrin incorporated during manufacture of the polyethylene fibre) and an untreated intact net performed well in preventing both Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes from feeding on people using them overnight in the experimental huts. Anopheles showed high mortality rates in response to pyrethroid-treated nets, but only bendiocarb treated curtains killed many Culex. Holed nets treated with either cyfluthrin (5 EW formulation applied at the rate of 50 mg a.i./m2) or lambda-cyhalothrin (2.5 CS formulation at 10 mg a.i./m2) performed well after 15 months of domestic use. Treatment with deltamethrin SC or lambda-cyhalothrin CS at the very low rate of 3 mg/m2 gave good results, including after washing and re-treatment."

The F1 larval progeny obtained from wild caught human biting S. damnosum and reared in the laboratory were chromosomally examined. 509 F1 larvae from 70 females blood fed on human volunteers were identified as Kiwira form. As the main human-biting member of the complex in the Tukuyu area, and because some of the wild caught females had developing filarial larvae indistinguishable from those of Onchocerca volvulus, Kiwira form is thus incriminated as the local vector of onchocerciasis.

Meanwhile, malaria remains a major environmental factor causing serious pregnancy complications, whose incidence and severity depend on gestational age, parity, and the level of malaria endemicity. There is no cohesive explanation for pregnancy-related immunosuppression, though several pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed. Furthermore, the emergence and rapid spread of chloroquine resistance has complicated the epidemiology, and the policy on alternative chemoprophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis is probably the only available option for the control of malaria during pregnancy in Africa. However, the best delivery strategy still has to be established. Daily proguanil is the best chemoprophylactic drug at hand. Its deployment should include constant monitoring for the emergence of proguanil resistance, as well as controlled supervision of the distribution of the drug. New control options, such as the use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, and intermittent targeted mass chemotherapy, require more operational research before they can be broadly recommended."

Blood smears of infants were examined for parasitaemia once fortnightly. Parasitaemias were treated with either amodiaquine, Fansidar, or Fansidar-quinine combination. In all cohorts, the incidence of malaria parasitaemias within 3 months of age was high (overall mean = 63%). Chloroquine released from its tissue bound form in the CQ and CQ+PROG-cohorts did not have significant chemosuppressive effects on the parasitaemias. Acknowledging that the CQ-prophylaxis group simulated the hypothetical control group, the cohorts similarity in the pattern of parasitaemias suggested that effective maternal malaria chemoprophylaxis during pregnancy did not significantly influence infancy malaria. A sharp rise in incidence around 3 months was indicative of the waning effect of passive immunity. Sole dependence on sub-optimal active immunity led to another sharp rise in incidence from 9 months onwards. The high incidence of infancy malaria parasitaemias calls for increased vigilance in their early detection and effective treatment. Social-cultural factors within the communities may constrain effective disease management."

Detailed larval salivary gland polytene chromosome maps are presented for two taxa designated S. neavei Amani form A and S. neavei Amani form B, which are probably synonymous with the previously described morphospecies, S. nyasalandicum and S. woodi, respectively. Simulium neavei Amani form B differs from S. neavei Amani form A by three paracentric inversions, a large deletion and a chromocentre, while the latter taxon differs from the former one by a mid-arm interchange. The fixed mid-arm interchange (1-tr) between two related taxa is unique among the Simuliidae. Detailed banding analysis of S. neavei Amani form B shows that, relative to S. neavei Amani form A, sections 16a, 16b, and 17c of the short arm of chromosome one (IS) have been inserted into section 69/70 of the short arm of chromosome three (IIIS). Assignment of directionality for this interchange inferred because of the near universality in the Simuliidae of a chromosome III long arm to short arm ratio of 2:1. We propose that the mid-arm interchange acted as a primary isolating mechanism because of the segregational load on F1 heterozygous interchange progeny. The magnitude of the segregational load would be dependent on the frequency of pairing and crossing-over between the transposed interstitial segment and its original counterpart in the chromosome complement. Nonpairing in the transposed region and normal random segregation would presumably lead to a 50% of gametes carrying the duplicated or deficient transposed segment, resulting in a segregation load of 50%. However, crossing-over in the paired interstitial region may greatly increase segregational load as result of multivalent formation at metaphase one (MI) and the generation of dicentric bridge(s) and acentric fragment(s) upon cell division. Such meiotic disjunction irregularities could lead to meiotic arrest, gametic loss and (or) cell restitution, and the eventual formation of polyploid (lethal) zygotes."

Dyspnea, fever, night sweat, fatigue, and diarrhea, severe tachypnea, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy were significantly more common in HIV-infected than in HIV-negative patients with TB. The same applied to a negative Mantoux reaction, lower hemoglobin, higher beta 2-microglobulin values, and in pleural fluid, lower albumin and higher gamma-globulin levels. Among HIV-infected patients, PPD skin test anergy was significantly associated with relative low albumin and gamma-globulin levels of pleural fluid. However, the radiographic features did not differ with respect to HIV status; they were predominantly those of primary pleuritis (78% in each group).

Fifty-four patients with pure falciparum malaria were treated with CQ and followed daily for 3 days and weekly for one month. Eighty-three per cent of infections exhibited some degree of in-vivo resistance to CQ (46% RI, 28% RII and 9% RIII). Pretreatment blood samples were obtained from all 54 patients for in-vitro sensitivity testing for CQ, amodiaquine (AQ), quinine (QN), and mefloquine (MQ).

Urine HPTLC revealed CQ metabolites in 15% of study patients who denied recent CQ ingestion and had a negative Dill-Glazko test. This implies the high rate of CQ resistance observed in this study could be due in part to the widespread use of CQ for self-medication. Although the day 3 mean CQ plasma level was higher for sensitive and RI infections than for RII and RIII infections, the difference did not reach statistical significance. Our study results confirm that P. falciparum transmitted at Amani is highly resistant to CQ."

To establish the sustainability and costs of surveillance. DESIGN: Sentinel surveillance for HIV through serial collection of unlinked, anonymous seroprevalence data from antenatal care; comparison of sentinel data with those from a population serosurvey; financial and general audit of the sentinel surveillance. SETTING: A community antenatal clinic in a large urban centre, Mwanza Municipality, Tanzania, eastern Africa, between October 1988 and September 1991. PATIENTS: Pregnant women attending for antenatal care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Age-specific HIV-1 seroprevalences, trends over time, difference from age-specific population seroprevalences, sustainability and costs. RESULTS: Overall HIV-1 seroprevalence was 11.5% (95% confidence interval, 10.5-12.4); differences in age-specific prevalences were not significant. There was no clear evidence of change in seroprevalence over the study period in any age group, although there was some indication of a rise in some age groups in 1988-1989. Sentinel surveillance among pregnant women may have significantly underestimated population HIV-1 seroprevalence for women under the age of 35 years. HIV-1 surveillance proved feasible and sustainable. Additional recurrent costs were US$1.7 per specimen for unlinked anonymous testing and US$0.57 per woman for syphilis screening. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 seroprevalence did not change significantly over 3 years, probably implying a substantial incidence of HIV-1 infection. In this setting seroprevalence in pregnant women may have underestimated population seroprevalence in women aged under 35 years. With modest inputs and good organization unlinked anonymous HIV-1 sentinel surveillance of pregnant women can be introduced and sustained in an African setting. This may usefully be carried out in conjunction with syphilis screening."

Bovine tuberculosis, tetanus, taeniosis, trichinosis and tungosis are also endemic in some parts of the country but records of their incidences are not available. Initial outbreaks of trypanosomiasis in Tanzania were caused by Trypanosoma gambiense which originated from West Africa and reached Tanzania via Zaire around 1902. T. rhodesiense which is currently responsible for human trypanosomiasis in Tanzania was introduced from Mozambique around 1910 and quickly spread to many parts of the country. The disease is currently prevalent in the western, north and northwestern parts, the southern highlands and southern regions. Over 6000 cases have reported since 1979. Control strategies against sleeping sickness in Tanzania include chemical control of vectors, treatment of patients with trypanocides and avoidance of humantsetse contact. Plague is mostly endemic in central, northern and north-eastern Tanzania. A total of 8161 cases with 1885 deaths have been recorded since 1890. The disease is currently prevalent in Lushoto district where outbreaks have been experienced since 1980, and in Singida district where it has been endemic since 1918. Integrated control measures are currently applied and were possibly responsible for the 1989 decline of outbreaks in the area. Financial constraints which led to deterioration of control activities from July 1989 probably accounted for the severe outbreaks in 1990/91 which spread to other parts of the country. Rabies is endemic country-wide except in Mtwara, Lindi and Zanzibar. Domestic dogs are the principal transmitters and prompt vaccination and destruction of unvaccinated stray dogs are the main control measures. Brucellosis is widely endemic in livestock and potentially so in humans. Destruction of infected animals, immunisation of susceptible ones, proper boiling of milk and its products and chemotherapy are the currently applied control measures against the disease. Anthrax and hydatidosis are sparsely endemic in the country, and they are mostly controlled by appropriate meat inspection and consequent condemnation and proper disposal of the affected meat. Vaccination and treatment of animals are also effective against anthrax."

The number of mature eggs in those mosquitoes which became gravid was counted. Virgin females were fed and kept for egg maturation in the laboratory. Wing-length of females was measured as an index of mosquito size. The overall pre-gravid rate in the resting An.gambiae population was found to be 21% and, of these, 66% had been inseminated. In the virgin females the pre-gravid rate was 92.6%. The mean wing-length of wild females which became gravid was significantly larger than those which remained pre-gravid. There was a positive correlation between fecundity and wing-length. Smaller females tended to require two or three bloodmeals to facilitate completion of the first gonotrophic cycle. The critical size permitting oviposition from the first blood-meal was a wing-length of 3 mm."

METHODS--A population-based random cluster sample survey, stratified by rural, roadside or urban residence, of 4173 individuals aged 15-54 years was performed in 1990-91. The seroprevalence of syphilis and the prevalence and incidence of self-reported genital ulcer syndrome (GUS) and genital discharge syndrome (GDS) are reported in the accompanying paper. This paper reports on risk factors for these conditions and on health seeking behaviour among those reporting them. RESULTS--In both sexes, the risk of STDs increased with the reported number of sexual partners in the previous five years. Men who were separated, divorced or widowed were at increased risk of STDs, but this was not the case among women. Higher educational status was associated with an increased risk of urethral discharge in males but with a decreased prevalence of syphilis in females. Male circumcision was associated with an increased risk of urethral discharge but a reduced prevalence of syphilis. Nearly all men, and 90% of women, reporting symptoms of genital discharge or ulceration had sought treatment. Of these, approximately 70% of males and 60% of females had sought treatment in the official health sector.

Sustained increases in the mean Hb occurred in PG of the PROG and CQ+PROG groups. The mean Hb of PG of the CQ group decreased after an initial increase, possibly due to the selection of more and highly chloroquine-resistant strain(s). The mean birth weight of PG was highest in the CQ+PROG (2.89 kg) and least in the CQ group (2.71 kg). The CQ group had the highest low birth weight rate (LBW). The prevalence of placental malaria was highest in the CQ (28%) and lowest in the PROG group (12%). For all the prophylactic effects, PROG and CQ+PROG did not differ significantly. Thence, the deployment of CQ+PROG for prophylaxis would be unnecessary. Proguanil is a suitable alternative to chloroquine prophylaxis. Due to possible emergence of proguanil resistance, deployment of this drug should incorporate constant monitoring for resistance and the eventual prophylaxis efficacy.

Antibodies in women of the PROG group who were parasitaemic before the assessments decreased with the increasing number of breakthrough and clinical episodes. The converse was true for antibodies in the CQ and CQ + PROG groups. Group differences in the parasite densities would explain this. Parity and placental malaria did not influence titres significantly. Overall, antibodies of the CQ + PROG group decrease significantly with time, possibly due to its long period of aparasitaemia. This suggested interference with the immune responsiveness of the women. PROG, which was equally efficacious, offers better prophylaxis."

The first occurrence of a malaria parasitaemia in infants was independent of the levels of cord titres at birth. The results suggested that chemoprophylaxis as effective as PROG or CQ+PROG in holoendemic areas, insignificantly affects maternal-foetal transfer of anti-sporozoite antibodies, and that levels of these antibodies at birth do not modulate the first occurrence of infancy malaria parasitaemia. Interference with the maternal-foetal transfer of this antibody and possibly other component antibodies of passive immunity should not limit the selection of PROG or CQ+PROG for chemoprophylaxis."

All were residents of a malaria hyperendemic area in Muheza District, Tanzania. Supervised prophylaxis started early in pregnancy till delivery.

Overall, PMCs were mostly infrequent and light viz: fibrinous deposits (98%), fibrinoid necrosis (60%), leucocytic infiltrations (59%), macrophage containing pigment (16%), and malaria parasites (8%). The type, prevalence, and severity of the PMCs in the three prophylaxis groups were comparable. This was despite the fact that PROG and CQ+PROG were prophylactically more efficacious than CQ and despite the expectation that the prevalence and severity of the PMCs would be high in the CQ group. Prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of parasitaemias in this group contributed to the low prevalence and less severity. It is concluded that effective malaria chemoprophylaxis or prompt diagnosis and effective treatment of malaria parasitaemias have significant impact on the prevalence of PMCs. Due to various operational constraints in most developing countries, chemoprophylaxis remains the only feasible broad option for malaria control in pregnancy"

The taxonomic status of the populations under study are discussed in relation to previously published papers and unpublished reports. Dimorphisms for centromere band enhancement occur on all three polytene chromosomes of the complement. The same centromere band can be polymorphic, sex linked, fixed, or lost in various cytotypes. In constructing a partial phylogeny, a hypothetical intermediate is proposed to account for the diverse fate of these centromere band dimorphisms and other inversion polymorphisms in different members of this nearly pan African complex.

Fevers (temperature > or = 37.5 degrees C) in both children and adults showed irregular changes in prevalence over time, but there was no seasonal pattern. Neither was there seasonal variation in either P. falciparum parasite prevalence or parasite densities. This was despite marked seasonality in vectors caught in CDC light-traps and in estimated sporozoite inoculations determined by ELISA. The estimated mean annual inoculation rate was extremely high, over 300 infectious bites per person per year, the main vectors being members of the A. gambiae complex and Anopheles funestus. There was considerable variation between houses but even in houses with relatively low mosquito numbers the inoculation rate was sufficient to maintain a maximal P. falciparum prevalence. Heterogeneities in exposure cannot explain why the parasite prevalence is not always 100%. In areas of such high transmission, parasitaemias are likely to be determined mainly by the interaction of schizogony and anti-blood stage immunity, since parasites arising from new inoculations generally comprise only a small proportion of the total in the circulation. In any one individual, this will lead to periodic fluctuations in levels of parasitaemia. These are unlikely to show a close relationship to either seasonal variation in inoculations or to differences between households in the local inoculation rate."

Cases were 441 consecutively diagnosed patients with tuberculosis (all types), aged 15-54 years. Controls were a representative population sample of 4161 people, drawn in a stratified cluster sample from urban areas, roadside settlements, and rural villages. HIV-1 infection was determined by ELISA and if the ELISA result was indeterminate by Western Blot. The HIV-1 prevalence in cases was 23.0% in rural, 32.1% in roadside, and 54.1% in urban areas, while in controls these prevalences were 3.4%, 7.2% and 12.1% respectively. The relative risk (RR) of HIV-1 infection for the development of active tuberculosis was estimated to be 8.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.4-11.0). This risk varied little by sex or residence, but appeared to be more pronounced in the age group 25-34 years. The case detection rate of tuberculosis in those aged 15-54 years was 125/100,000 people per year. The population attributable risk was 36/100,000 people per year, implying that 29% of tuberculosis cases at present may be attributable to HIV-1 infection. It is concluded that HIV-1 infection is a major contributing factor to the increased case detection rate of tuberculosis observed over the past 10 years in Mwanza Region.

HIV-1 infection was 1.5 times more common in women than in men; 2.5% of the adult population in rural villages, 7.3% in roadside settlements and 11.8% in town were infected. HIV-1 infection occurred mostly in women aged 15-34 years and men aged 25-44 years. It was associated with being separated or widowed, multiple sex partners, presence of syphilis antibodies, history of genital discharge or genital ulcer, travel to Mwanza town, and receiving injections during the previous 12 months, but not with male circumcision. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that HIV-1 infection in this region in East Africa is more common in women than in men. The results are consistent with the spread of HIV-1 infection along the main roads. There is no evidence that lack of circumcision is a risk factor in this population."

We report findings at intake from October 1991 to March 1992. Study participants were interviewed, examined, and screened for HIV-1 and syphilis. HIV-1 prevalence was 91/926 (10%) in males and 36/217 (17%) in females. Statistically significant risk factors for HIV-1 infection in males were age group, region of birth, not being married for more than 5 years, being uncircumcised, having had a genital ulcer in the past four months, and having received injections from medical staff in the past four months. HIV-1 incidence in this group is expected to be between 1% and 2% per year. It is concluded that a longitudinal study is needed to assess the importance of partner change. This cohort appears to be suitable for such a study as HIV-1 incidence is expected to be fairly high, HIV-1 prevalence and risk factors are comparable to those of the general population and cooperation of the factory workers is good."

The performance of the three synthetic pyrethroids did not differ statistically significantly, except that on a damaged net permethrin was better at preventing feeding. Sisal eaves curtains deterred mosquitoes from hut entry but did not kill those that had entered. In assessing damaged nets and curtains it must be recognised that anything less than the best vector control may have no appreciable impact on holoendemic malaria."

The proportion of mosquitoes with sporozoites, and thus potentially infective to humans, was highest in intermediate-sized mosquitoes, whereas the largest and smallest mosquitoes were less likely to have sporozoites. This pattern is interpreted as a combination of high survival rate of large, uninfected mosquitoes and of low survival rate of mosquitoes infected with many oocysts."

Resultant CQ and PROG-cohorts of infants were followed up for prompt diagnosis and treatment of malaria. Infections were primarily treated with 25 mg base amodiaquine/kg over 3 days. By September 1990, 49 and 60 infants from PROG and CQ cohorts respectively had completed one year follow up. Thirty-five (71%) infants of PROG and 44 (73%) for CQ-cohort were infected with malaria before 3 months of age. The one year mean infection episode rates were 7 (PROG-cohort) and 6.6 (CQ-cohort). Amodiaquine cleared 209 (80%) of PROG's total infections and 224 (81%) for CQ-cohort, and significantly reduced the infection load among clearance failures. Clearance failures had high pre-treatment parasite densities whilst post-treatment densities were higher in the CQ-cohort than PROG-cohort. Low malaria immunity and chloroquine's long residence time could explain these differences. We conclude that early infancy malaria is common and should always be suspected, looked for and adequately treated. Amodiaquine is better than chloroquine for malaria primary therapy during infancy and early childhood."

Amodiaquine and FansidarR were fully effective in eliminating asexual parasitaemia from the blood in all the cases during the seven days of follow-up. The results indicate that chloroquine, a commonly used antimalarial in Tanzania, is not as effective as amodiaquine, a less used drug. Although the 'antifols' are still highly effective in Tanzania, their potency could change with continued use. These drugs should, therefore, be protected and used judiciously."

The pairs of adjacent catches by the different methods showed a strong correlation. Analysis of the ratio between the catches by the two methods on pairs of nights in the same week indicated that on average three light-traps caught about the same number of mosquitoes as a team of two human catchers. The ratio did not differ significantly between Anopheles gambiae Giles (sensu lato), A. funestus Giles, and Culex quinquefasciatus Say, nor between the villages, or between times when mosquito populations were high or low. The distribution of numbers of ovarian dilatations differed significantly between catches in different villages and seasons but not between pairs of catches by the two methods. Similarly, the parity and sporozoite rates agreed between pairs of light-trap and house-resting catches, but differed markedly between villages and seasons. Thus it is concluded that light-traps used in conjunction with bed nets catch a representative sample of the vectors which would have bitten humans in bedrooms in this area."

Age-specific sporozoite rates implied that mosquitoes acquired new infections at all ages. The extrinsic period lasted just over 3 gonotrophic cycles (9-11 days). Very high sporozoite rates in the oldest females implied the absence or rarity of genetic refractoriness to infection. A method is described for estimating the proportion of bloodmeals which result in mosquito infection. This method makes relatively few assumptions about mosquito behaviour, and could be useful for evaluating transmission-blocking interventions. Overall, it is estimated that about 21% of meals are infectious. This is much higher than previous estimates derived either from experimental mosquito feeding studies or from similar age-grading data collected from the same area in 1962. Various alternative explanations are considered, and it is concluded that there has been a 2.5-fold increase in human infectiousness in the last 25 years. This is partly attributable to suppression of human infectiousness by widespread chloroquine usage during the 1960s, followed by removal of this effect by drug resistance. It is argued that chloroquine would be expected to select for increased infectivity in the parasite, and this may also have contributed to the observed increase."

This concentration was by far over and above what is required (ie, 100 mg ground pods/1) to kill 10% of the pulmonate hosts of schistosomiasis. It seems that the application of S. madagascariensis at a concentration inimical to pulmonates (ie, 100 mg ground ponds/1 or slightly higher) in habitats where M. cornuarietis is introduced may not adversely affected to competitor snail population.

The average duration of infective life for P. falciparum was 0.2 days for both An. arabiensis and An. funestus. In contrast, entomological inoculation rates were comparatively high: 6-8 infective bites/man/month. An. pharoensis averaged 110 bites/man/night during the short rains; 1/999 (0.1%) was positive by ELISA for P. falciparum circumsporozoite antigen, but the ELISA evidence is not conclusive for vector incrimination. In correspondence with clinical observations, the transmission of P. malariae and P. ovale is unlikely due to the low vector survival rates. The observed anomaly between low vectorial capacities and high entomological inoculation rates demonstrates the importance of accurately estimating vector sporozoite rates to monitor unstable malaria transmission in irrigated areas."

The results showed a marked fall in biting S. neavei s.l. females and supported earlier findings on the aquatic stages. The mean biting-catch in 1985/6 was only 13% of that in 1963/4 and comprised 91% S. woodi and 9% the more common, but largely zoophilic, Simulium nyasalandicum (Amani form). The infection rate of S. woodi with Onchocerca volvulus larvae had also fallen markedly from 17% to 3% of parous flies; no S. nyasalandicum females were infected. Recent onchocerciasis surveys indicate that reduced transmission has resulted in lower infection rates in man. Exposure by deforestation of the breeding sites of S. woodi in small shaded streams seems to have caused the simuliid's population decline. Reduced populations of S. neavei group vector species have been reported in other deforested parts of eastern Africa. Our long-term quantitative data on declining numbers of biting females without control measures, help to corroborate such reports. Control may no longer be necessary in some areas allowing a greater concentration of limited resources."

Africa where chemosuppression with chloroquine had been attempted since 1977. Within 1½ years there were signs of a decreasing drug response. Chloroquine resistance was first detected in 1981 and this increased markedly in 1982. Other contributory causes for the rise of parasite rates in children were possibly a decline in the efficiency of the drug distribution system and also immunological factors. Evidence of resistance to pyrimethamine was also found. Observations were made of the heterogeneity of the parasites' responses with emerging resistance. Implications for the future are discussed.

The swarms are composed of males and are found between the houses of rural villages at sites with open ground and a free view of the sky. Swarming takes place at dusk, in a period of about 20 minutes during which the light intensity decreases from about 55 to 1 lux. Matings in, or near, the swarms are recorded. Spacial nor temporal differences are found between swarms of the two species and evidence is given for a case of mixed swarming in an area where they coexist.

In a third village, larviciding with chlorpyrifos against Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus in pit latrines reduced the infective bites from 187 to 12. The corresponding reduction was from 24 to nine in a fourth village, where the control procedures integrated simple environmental measures with the use of larvicides (chlorpyrifos in pit-latrines and temephos to control Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae in temporary pools). Because of the wide variation in transmission patterns within the same geographical area and even in the same locality in that area at different times a flexible approach to filariasis control is necessary.

Quantitative studies on the intensity of transmission were conducted over a period of 17 months. The estimated potential infective bites per person per year varied from 24 to 189. The number of infective bites was related to filarial endemicity. The vectors in order of importance were Anopheles gambiae s.l., Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus and An. funestus. In all villages An. gambiae s.l. played a role in transmission and in two it was the main vector. Of the total estimated bites by members of the gambiae complex, 16 223 (91·1%) occurred during or following the ‘long rains’ (April to early June). In contrast, transmission by C. p. quinquefasciatus occurred throughout the year. In one village in which C. p. quinquefasciatus was the predominant vector, the biting density of this species was 22 times greater than the biting density of An. gambiae s.l. The level of the microfilaria reservoir in the human population and the density of the vectors were important factors influencing the intensity of transmission."

This rapid decrease in microfilaraemia associated with the addition of levamisole overcomes a major disadvantage of using DEC alone—namely the necessity to commence spaced dose treatment several months before the transmission season. A further advantage of combined levamisole-DEC therapy is that levamisole is effective in ascariasis and hookworm—conditions which often co-exist in areas endemic for Bancroftian filariasis"

A direct test for the existence of such individuals in A. gambiae s.l. and A. funestus Giles in a village in Tanzania was made by catching resting mosquitoes indoors and in outdoor pits, differentially marking them according to their site of capture and releasing them from a single site. Recaptures indoors and in the pits showed no significant association between the sites of capture and recapture among the females of either species, i.e. no evidence for an invariably outdoor-resting type of female. It is concluded that behavioural polymorphism is unlikely to interfere with the successful use of house spraying for malaria control in this area. From data on the proportion of the captures found to be marked and on the parity rate, estimates were calculated of the total mosquito population available for sampling in the village."

Chloroquine resistance was first detected in 1981 and this increased markedly in 1982. Other contributory causes for the rise of parasite rates in children were possibly a decline in the efficiency of the drug distribution system and also immunological factors. Evidence of resistance to pyrimethamine was also found. Observations were made of the heterogeneity of the parasites' responses with emerging resistance. Implications for the future are discussed.

The swarms are composed of males and are found between the houses of rural villages at sites with open ground and a free view of the sky. Swarming takes place at dusk, in a period of about 20 minutes during which the light intensity decreases from about 55 to 1 lux. Matings in, or near, the swarms are recorded. Spacial nor temporal differences are found between swarms of the two species and evidence is given for a case of mixed swarming in an area where they coexist.

Hydrocoele and elephantiasis rates were 39% and 3%, respectively. The rates and severity of these 2 clinical manifestations increased in the older age groups. Both the microfilarial density and prevalence increased rapidly in the early age groups, followed by a levelling off and then a slight fall in old age. There was no association between microfilarial densities or rates and the overall prevalence of hydrocoele, but a negative association was demonstrated between microfilaraemia and hydrocoeles and elephantiasis. A comparison between the length of residence in an endemic area and the microfilarial and clinical sign rates showed evidence for the long incubation period for W. bancrofti and for the slow development of hydrocoeles and elephantiasis."

In two villages the mass administration of diethylcarbamazine in spaced doses over six months (total dose 54 to 72 mg kg?1 per person), reduced the infective bites per person per year from 189 to 13 and 41 to nil, respectively, despite a persistent microfilaraemia in the villagers of 3·8%. In a third village, larviciding with chlorpyrifos against Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus in pit latrines reduced the infective bites from 187 to 12. The corresponding reduction was from 24 to nine in a fourth village, where the control procedures integrated simple environmental measures with the use of larvicides (chlorpyrifos in pit-latrines and temephos to control Anopheles gambiae s.l. larvae in temporary pools). Because of the wide variation in transmission patterns within the same geographical area and even in the same locality in that area at different times a flexible approach to filariasis control is necessary. It is concluded that a combination of larviciding, simple environmental procedures and chemotherapy can greatly reduce filariasis transmission in any endemic area of Tanzania"

Quantitative studies on the intensity of transmission were conducted over a period of 17 months. The estimated potential infective bites per person per year varied from 24 to 189. The number of infective bites was related to filarial endemicity. The vectors in order of importance were Anopheles gambiae s.l., Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus and An. funestus. In all villages An. gambiae s.l. played a role in transmission and in two it was the main vector. Of the total estimated bites by members of the gambiae complex, 16 223 (91·1%) occurred during or following the ‘long rains’ (April to early June). In contrast, transmission by C. p. quinquefasciatus occurred throughout the year. In one village in which C. p. quinquefasciatus was the predominant vector, the biting density of this species was 22 times greater than the biting density of An. gambiae s.l. The level of the microfilaria reservoir in the human population and the density of the vectors were important factors influencing the intensity of transmission

This rapid decrease in microfilaraemia associated with the addition of levamisole overcomes a major disadvantage of using DEC alone—namely the necessity to commence spaced dose treatment several months before the transmission season. A further advantage of combined levamisole-DEC therapy is that levamisole is effective in ascariasis and hookworm—conditions which often co-exist in areas endemic for Bancroftian filariasis.

The effect of excreted ivermectin on non-target organisms in aquatic and terrestrial environments has been increasingly reported. Due to its low water solubility and adsorption to sediments, the ivermectin exposure-risk to aquatic organisms dwelling in different strata of water bodies varies. This study assessed the survival of larvae of Anopheles gambiae Giles and Culex quinquefasciatus Say, when exposed to low concentrations of ivermectin under laboratory conditions. Methods A total of 1800 laboratory reared mosquito larvae of each species were used in the bioassays. Twelve replicates were performed, each testing 6 concentrations of ivermectin (0.0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 parts per million (ppm)) against third instar larvae of An. gambiae and Cx. quinquefasciatus. Larval mortality was recorded at 24 and 48 h post addition of ivermectin. Results Survival declined markedly with increase in ivermectin concentration in both species. While mean survival of An. gambiae at 24 h of exposure was 99.6 %, 99.2 % and 61.6 % in 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 ppm of ivermectin, respectively, the mean survival of Cx. quinquefasciatus at the same dosage and time was 89.2 %, 47.2 % and 0.0 %. A similar pattern, but with higher mortality, was observed after 48 h of exposure. Comparison between the species revealed that Cx. quinquefasciatus larvae were significantly more affected by ivermectin than those of An. gambiae, both at 24 and 48 h. Conclusions Low concentrations of ivermectin in the aquatic environment reduced the survival of larvae of An. gambiae and Cx. quinquefasciatus, with the effect being more marked in the latter species. It is suggested that this difference may be due to the different water strata occupied by the two species, with ivermectin adsorbed in food that sediment being more readily available to the bottom feeding Cx. quinquefasciatus than the surface feeding An. gambiae larvae."

The objective of the conference was to revisit past disease epidemics and to reflect on the current status of surveillance and outbreak preparedness in Tanzania, including an overview of agents relevant to biosecurity. The conference brought together national authorities of Tanzania, regional public health representatives, people from research and academic institutions, and international stakeholders. Key findings of the event were: (1) although national frameworks for surveillance and preparedness exist, their implementation presents challenges, and local health structures need support in implementation; (2) the ability to identify and properly manage infectious diseases of public health concern is crucial in empowering the local health workforce to contribute to surveillance measures, which in turn allows for realistic risk assessments and management algorithms; and (3) in settings of limited resources, research activities acquire an additional responsibility toward national surveillance and capacity building and should be integrated into national epidemic preparedness plans. This event was the first of its kind in Tanzania, facilitating direct discussion among regional, zonal, national, and international stakeholders on surveillance and outbreak preparedness. The conference's conclusions are relevant to strengthening health systems in other low- and middle-income countries."

Hut volume, construction materials and size of entry points impact mosquito entry and exposure to insecticides. The performance of three standard experimental hut designs was compared to evaluate insecticide used in LLINs. Field studies were conducted at the World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) testing site in Muheza, Tanzania. Three East African huts, three West African huts, and three Ifakara huts were compared using Olyset® and Permanet 2.0® versus untreated nets as a control. Outcomes measured were mortality, induced exophily (exit rate), blood feeding inhibition and deterrence (entry rate). Data were analysed using linear mixed effect regression and Bland–Altman comparison of paired differences. A total of 613 mosquitoes were collected in 36 nights, of which 13.5 % were Anopheles gambiae sensu lato, 21 % Anopheles funestus sensu stricto, 38 % Mansonia species and 28 % Culex species. Ifakara huts caught three times more mosquitoes than the East African and West African huts, while the West African huts caught significantly fewer mosquitoes than the other hut types. Mosquito densities were low, very little mosquito exit was measured in any of the huts with no measurable exophily caused by the use of either Olyset or Permanet. When the huts were directly compared, the West African huts measured greater exophily than other huts. As unholed nets were used in the experiments and few mosquitoes were captured, it was not possible to measure difference in feeding success either between treatments or hut types. In each of the hut types there was increased mortality when Permanet or Olyset were present inside the huts compared to the control, however this did not vary between the hut types. Both East African and Ifakara huts performed in a similar way although Ifakara huts allowed more mosquitoes to enter, increasing data power. The work convincingly demonstrates that the East African huts and Ifakara huts collect substantially more mosquitoes than the West African huts"

Twenty-eight percent of these cases were in the World Health Organization (WHO) Africa Region, where the annual case detection rate was 281 per 100000 population-more than double the global average of 133 per 100000. Of the 9.6 million people who developed TB, an estimated 1.2 million (12%) were HIV-positive, and the Africa Region accounted for 74% of these cases. Three million people with TB remain undiagnosed and untreated. Globally, an estimated 480000 had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Whilst of the African countries, only South Africa has reported a high prevalence of MDR-TB, it is likely that all of Sub-Saharan Africa has an unreported high load of drug-resistant TB. Tragically, in 2014, only 48% of individuals diagnosed with MDR-TB had successful treatment and an estimated 190000 people died of MDR-TB. Of the global TB funding gap of US$ 0.8 billion, the largest funding gap was in the Africa Region, amounting to US$ 0.4 billion in 2015. The MDR-TB pandemic in particular now threatens to devastate entire regions and may fundamentally alter the life-expectancy and demographic profile of many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The theme designated for this year's World TB Day, March 24, 2016, is 'Unite to End TB'. From the Africa Region, there is an urgent need to seriously address the political, economic, and social factors that influence host-Mycobacterium tuberculosis interactions and result in disease. Recent political and funder initiatives that provide renewed hope for the alleviation of Africa's TB and TB/HIV problems are discussed."

A modified and sensitive laboratory prototype, Magnetic Deposition Microscopy (MDM) was developed to increase the detection of sub-microscopic parasitaemia and estimation of gametocytes density in asymptomatic school children.                                                                                                                                         Methods: Blood samples were collected from 303 asymptomatic school children from seven villages in Bagamoyo district in Tanzania. Participants were screened for presence of malaria parasites in the field using RDT and MDM whereas further examination of malaria parasites was done in the laboratory by LM. LM and MDM readings were used to calculate densities and estimate prevalence of asexual and sexual stages of the parasite.                                                                                                                                                                                                       Results: Plasmodium falciparum parasites (asexual and sexual stages) were detected in 23 (7.6 %), 52 (17.2 %), and 59 (19.5 %) out of 303 samples by LM, RDT and MDM respectively. Gametocytes were detected in 4 (1.3 %) and 12 (4.0 %) out of the same numbers of samples by LM, and MDM, respectively. Likewise, in vitro results conducted on two laboratory strains of P. falciparum, 3D7 and NF54 to assess MDM sensitivity on gametocytes detection and its application on concentrating gametocytes indicated that gametocytes were enriched by MDM by 10-fold higher than LM. Late stages of the parasite strains, 3D7 and NF54 were enriched by MDM by a factor of 20.5 and 35.6, respectively. MDM was more specific than LM and RDT by 87.5 % (95 %, CI 71.2–89.6 %) and 89.0 % (95 % CI 82.9–91.4) respectively. It was also found that MDM sensitivity was 62.5 % (95 % CI 49.5–71.8) when compared with RDT while with LM was 36.5 % (95 % CI 32.2–60.5).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Conclusions: These findings provide strong evidence that MDM enhanced detection of sub-microscopic P. falciparum infections and estimation of gametocyte density compared to current malaria diagnostic tools. In addition, MDM is superior to LM in detecting sub-microscopic gametocytaemia. Therefore, MDM is a potential tool for low-level parasitaemia identification and quantification with possible application in malaria transmission research"

A standardized chemical attractant dispenser derived from grass infusion, the AtrAedes™ lure, has been produced for the surveillance of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. A study using this lure in combination with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gravid traps was conducted in Tanga, Tanzania. The addition of the lure to traps baited with either grass infusion or tap water did not result in significant increases in trap catch. Grass infusion-baited traps (with and without the AtrAedes lure) collected significantly more Cx. quinquefasciatus than traps baited with AtrAedes + tap water, tap water alone, or AtrAedes alone. The catches of the traps baited with AtrAedes + tap water, tap water alone, and AtrAedes alone were not significantly different from each other. Although the placement of the lure in the base of the trap may have decreased trap catches, it seems that the AtrAedes is not as effective as grass infusion for collecting Cx. quinquefasciatus in Tanzania.

These efforts are critical for curbing HAT incidences and HAT epidemics. HAT cases have had profound negative impacts on human health, affecting local residents and international travel as well as tourism industry resulting into human and animal health burden and reduction in tourism income. Understanding the current efforts is essential in the proper planning and decision making on developing effective control strategy against T & T control. In this paper, we summarize the recent efforts in the control of T & T in National Parks and discuss the constraints faced. The information will enable TANAPA and other concerned authorities to make informed decision on optimal ways of controlling HAT in National Parks. The results show that much control efforts have so far concentrated in Serengeti, Ruaha, Tarangire and Katavi National Parks where tsetse fly challenges are high. A total 21,143 (average 3020) Insecticide Treated Targets (ITT) were deployed in different areas in the parks and 82,899 (average 20,725) cars entering these parks were sprayed from 2007/2008 to 2014/2015 and 2007/2008 to 2010/2011 respectively. Deployed ITTs lead to a drastic reduction of FTDs of the two dominant tsetse species to 1.3 and 1.4 of G. swynnertoni and G. pallidipes respectively, and the decline was significant at P = 0.011. The major challenges faced include tsetse re-invasion in controlled areas; resurgence of HAT cases when control efforts are relaxed, ITT maintenance and inadequate health education programs. The control strategy should be continuous and scaled up as failure to implement an effective and sustainable system for HAT control will increase the risk of new epidemic that would impede tourism development."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of nevirapine and subclinical mastitis on HIV-1 RNA in maternal plasma and breast milk after intrapartum single-dose nevirapine combined with either 1-week tail of Combivir (zidovudine/lamivudine) or single-dose Truvada (tenofovir/emtricitabine).                                                                                                                METHODS: Maternal plasma and bilateral breast milk samples were collected between April 2008 and April 2011 at 1, 4 and 6 weeks postpartum from HIV-infected Tanzanian women. Moreover, plasma samples were collected at delivery from mother and infant.                                                                                                                                                                                           RESULTS: HIV-1 RNA was quantified in 1,212 breast milk samples from 273 women. At delivery, 96% of the women and 99% of the infants had detectable nevirapine in plasma with a median (interquartile range, IQR) of 1.5 ?g/mL (0.75-2.20 ?g/mL) and 1.04 ?g/mL (0.39-1.71 ?g/mL), respectively (P < 0.001). At 1 week postpartum, 93% and 98% of the women had detectable nevirapine in plasma and breast milk, with a median (IQR) of 0.13 ?g/mL (0.13-0.39 ?g/mL) and 0.22 ?g/mL (0.13-0.34 ?g/mL), respectively. Maternal plasma and breast milk HIV-1 RNA correlated at all visits (R = 0.48, R = 0.7, R = 0.59; all P = 0.01). Subclinical mastitis was detected in 67% of the women at some time during 6 weeks, and in 38% of the breast milk samples. Breast milk samples with subclinical mastitis had significantly higher HIV-1 RNA at 1, 4 and 6 weeks (all P < 0.05).

Screening algorithms, starting with chest X-rays (CXRs), can detect asymptomatic cases, but depend on experienced readers, who are scarce in the penitentiary setting. Recent studies with patients seeking health care for TB-related symptoms showed good diagnostic performance of the computer software CAD4TB. OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential of computer-assisted screening using CAD4TB in a predominantly asymptomatic prison population.

RESULTS: CAD4TB and seven health care professionals reading CXRs in local tuberculosis wards evaluated a set of 511 CXRs from the Ukonga prison in Dar es Salaam. Performance was compared using a radiological reference. Two readers performed significantly better than CAD4TB, three were comparable, and two performed significantly worse (area under the curve 0.75 in receiver operating characteristics analysis). On a superset of 1321 CXRs, CAD4TB successfully interpreted >99%, with a predictably short time to detection, while 160 (12.2%) reports were delayed by over 24 h with conventional CXR reading.

Various factors influence adherence, however, few are easily modifiable. There are limited data regarding correlates of psychological distress and their association with non-adherence to anti-TB treatment.   Methods: In a trial of a new TB test, we measured psychological distress (K-10 score), TB-related health literacy, and morbidity (TBscore), prior to diagnosis in 1502 patients with symptoms of pulmonary TB recruited from clinics in Cape Town (n = 419), Harare (n = 400), Lusaka (n = 400), Durban (n = 200), and Mbeya (n = 83). Socioeconomic, demographic, and alcohol usage-related data were captured. Patients initiated on treatment had their DOTS cards reviewed at two-and six-months.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Results: 22 %(95 % CI: 20 %, 25 %) of patients had severe psychological distress (K-10 ? 30). In a multivariable linear regression model, increased K-10 score was independently associated with previous TB [estimate (95 % CI) 0.98(0.09-1.87); p = 0.0304], increased TBscore [1(0.80, 1.20); p <0.0001], and heavy alcohol use [3.08(1.26, 4.91); p = 0.0010], whereas male gender was protective [-1.47(?2.28, ?0.62); p = 0.0007]. 26 % (95 % CI: 21 %, 32 %) of 261 patients with culture-confirmed TB were non-adherent. In a multivariable logistic regression model for non-adherence, reduced TBscore [OR (95 % CI) 0.639 (0.497, 0.797); p = 0.0001], health literacy score [0.798(0.696, 0.906); p = 0.0008], and increased K-10 [1.082(1.033, 1.137); p = 0.0012], and heavy alcohol usage [14.83(2.083, 122.9); p = 0.0002], were independently associated. Culture-positive patients with a K-10 score ? 30 were more-likely to be non-adherent (OR = 2.290(1.033-5.126); p = 0.0416].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Conclusion: Severe psychological distress is frequent amongst TB patients in Southern Africa. Targeted interventions to alleviate psychological distress, alcohol use, and improve health literacy in newly-diagnosed TB patients could reduce non-adherence to treatment.

Remotely sensed ecological data and model-based geostatistics have been used recently to identify areas in need for hookworm control.                                                                                                                                                 METHODOLOGY: Cross-sectional interview data and stool samples from 6,375 participants from nine different sites in Mbeya region, south-western Tanzania, were collected as part of a cohort study. Hookworm infection was assessed by microscopy of duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears from one stool sample from each participant. A geographic information system was used to obtain remotely sensed environmental data such as land surface temperature (LST), vegetation cover, rainfall, and elevation, and combine them with hookworm infection data and with socio-demographic and behavioral data. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression was performed on sites separately and on the pooled dataset.                                               PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Univariable analyses yielded significant associations for all ecological variables. Five ecological variables stayed significant in the final multivariable model: population density (odds ratio (OR)?=?0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI)?=?0.63-0.73), mean annual vegetation density (OR?=?0.11; 95% CI?=?0.06-0.18), mean annual LST during the day (OR?=?0.81; 95% CI?=?0.75-0.88), mean annual LST during the night (OR?=?1.54; 95% CI?=?1.44-1.64), and latrine coverage in household surroundings (OR?=?1.02; 95% CI?=?1.01-1.04). Interaction terms revealed substantial differences in associations of hookworm infection with population density, mean annual enhanced vegetation index, and latrine coverage between the two sites with the highest prevalence of infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                       CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports previous findings that remotely sensed data such as vegetation indices, LST, and elevation are strongly associated with hookworm prevalence. However, the results indicate that the influence of environmental conditions can differ substantially within a relatively small geographic area. The use of large-scale associations as a predictive tool on smaller scales is therefore problematic and should be handled with care."

Screening of Ornithodoros sp ticks from infested houses for the presence of B duttonii had detected a previously unidentified species of Borrelia. We investigated whether this species infected the human population in a central Tanzanian village, by use of blood slide examination and PCR. PCR was twice as sensitive in detection of infections, showing Borrelia sp in six (11%) of 54 children with fever, and in 13 (4%) of 307 otherwise healthy children. Genotyping Borrelia from 17 infections identified Borrelia duttonii and an unnamed species. Our findings show that the newly discovered species is a causal agent of tick-borne relapsing fever."
